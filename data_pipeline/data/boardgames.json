At the beginning, the game starts in a very similar fashion as basic Pandemic, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hot spots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.\n\nDuring a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.\n\nAfter a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to.\n\nEach month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards.\n\nDuring the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects.

Every faction offers a completely different play experience, from the wormhole-hopping Ghosts of Creuss to the Emirates of Hacan, masters of trade and economics. These seventeen races are offered many paths to victory, but only one may sit upon the throne of Mecatol Rex as the new masters of the galaxy.\n\nNo two games of Twilight Imperium are ever identical. At the start of each galactic age, the game board is uniquely and strategically constructed from among 51 galaxy tiles that feature everything from lush new planets and supernovas to asteroid fields and gravity rifts. Players are dealt a hand of these tiles and take turns creating the galaxy around Mecatol Rex, the capital planet seated in the center of the board. An ion storm may block your race from progressing through the galaxy while a fortuitously placed gravity rift may protect you from your closest foes. The galaxy is yours to both craft and dominate.\n\nA round of Twilight Imperium begins with players selecting one of eight strategy cards that both determine player order and give their owner a unique strategic action for that round. These may do anything from providing additional command tokens to allowing a player to control trade throughout the galaxy. After these strategies are selected, players take turns moving their fleets from system to system, claiming new planets for their empires, and engaging in warfare and trade with other factions. At the end of a turn, players gather in a grand council to pass new laws and agendas, shaking up the game in unpredictable ways.\n\nAfter every player has passed their turn, players move up the victory track by checking to see whether they have completed any objectives throughout the turn and scoring them. Objectives are determined by setting up ten public objective cards at the start of each game, then gradually revealing them over the course of the game. Each player also chooses between two random secret objectives at the start of the game, achievement of which provides victory points--only for the holder of that objective. These objectives can be anything from researching new technologies to taking your neighbor's home system. At the end of every turn, a player can claim one public objective and one secret objective. As play continues, more of these objectives are revealed and more secret objectives are dealt out, giving players dynamically changing goals throughout the game.

In Rebellion, you control the entire Galactic Empire or the fledgling Rebel Alliance. You must command starships, account for troop movements, and rally systems to your cause. Given the differences between the Empire and Rebel Alliance, each side has different win conditions, and you'll need to adjust your play style depending on who you represent:\n\n     As the Imperial player, you can command legions of Stormtroopers, swarms of TIEs, Star Destroyers, and even the Death Star. You rule the galaxy by fear, relying on the power of your massive military to enforce your will. To win the game, you need to snuff out the budding Rebel Alliance by finding its base and obliterating it. Along the way, you can subjugate worlds or even destroy them.\n     As the Rebel player, you can command dozens of troopers, T-47 airspeeders, Corellian corvettes, and fighter squadrons. However, these forces are no match for the Imperial military. In terms of raw strength, you'll find yourself clearly overmatched from the very outset, so you'll need to rally the planets to join your cause and execute targeted military strikes to sabotage Imperial build yards and steal valuable intelligence. To win the Galactic Civil War, you'll need to sway the galaxy's citizens to your cause. If you survive long enough and strengthen your reputation, you inspire the galaxy to a full-scale revolt, and you win.\n\n\nFeaturing more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy's most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it.\n\nYet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic. As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy.

As the great powers of Europe stretch their colonial empires further and further, they will inevitably lay claim to a place where spirits still hold power - and when they do, the land itself will fight back alongside the islanders who live there.\n\nSpirit Island is a complex and thematic co-operative game about defending your island home from colonizing Invaders. Players are different spirits of the land, each with its own unique elemental powers. Every turn, players simultaneously choose which of their power cards to play, paying energy to do so. Using combinations of power cards that match a spirit's elemental affinities can grant free bonus effects. Faster powers take effect immediately, before the Invaders spread and ravage, but other magics are slower, requiring forethought and planning to use effectively. In the Spirit phase, spirits gain energy, and choose how / whether to Grow: to reclaim used power cards, to seek new power, or to spread their presence into new areas of the island.\n\nThe Invaders expand across the island map in a semi-predictable fashion. Each turn they explore into some lands (portions of the island); the next turn, they build in those lands, forming towns and cities. The turn after that, they ravage there, bringing blight to the land and attacking any native islanders present. The islanders fight back against the Invaders when attacked, and lend the spirits some other aid, but may not always do so exactly as you'd hoped. Some Powers work through the islanders, helping them, for example, to drive out the Invaders or clean the land of blight.\n\nThe game escalates as it progresses: spirits spread their presence to new parts of the island and seek out new and more potent powers, while the Invaders step up their colonization efforts. Each turn represents 1-3 years of alternate history. At game start, winning requires destroying every last explorer, town and city on the board - but as you frighten the Invaders more and more, victory becomes easier: they'll run away even if explorers or even towns and cities remain. Defeat comes if any spirit is destroyed, if the island is overrun by blight, or if the Invader deck is depleted before achieving victory.\n\nThe game includes different adversaries to fight against (eg., a Swedish Mining Colony, or a Remote British Colony). Each changes play in different ways, and offers a different path of difficulty boosts to keep the game challenging as you gain skill.", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kjCm4ZvPjIZxS-mYgSPy1g__small/img/aUlIih2_R7P8IYKeyNl2heLQbu8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7013651.jpg", "complexity": 4.0763, "min_players": 1, "max_players": 4, "playing_time": 120, "categories": ["Environmental", "Fantasy", "Mythology", "Territory Building"], "mechanics": ["Action Retrieval", "Area Majority / Influence", "Automatic Resource Growth", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Cooperative Game", "Deck, Bag, and Pool Building", "Hand Management", "Modular Board", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Tags", "Variable Player Powers", "Variable Set-up"], "types": ["strategygames"], "bestwith": [2], "recommendedwith": [1, 2, 3, 4], "pareto_rank": 7, "id": 162886}, {"name": "Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion", "yearpublished": 2020, "bayesaverage": 8.11086, "average": 8.37521, "usersrated": 39537, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/291457", "description": "Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion is a standalone game that takes place before the events of Gloomhaven.

Kennedy\n\nIn 1945, unlikely allies toppled Hitler's war machine, while humanity's most devastating weapons forced the Japanese Empire to its knees in a storm of fire. Where once there stood many great powers, there then stood only two. The world had scant months to sigh its collective relief before a new conflict threatened. Unlike the titanic struggles of the preceding decades, this conflict would be waged not primarily by soldiers and tanks, but by spies and politicians, scientists and intellectuals, artists and traitors.\n\nTwilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. The entire world is the stage on which these two titans fight to make the world safe for their own ideologies and ways of life. The game begins amidst the ruins of Europe as the two new \"superpowers\" scramble over the wreckage of the Second World War, and ends in 1989, when only the United States remained standing.\n\nTwilight Struggle inherits its fundamental systems from the card-driven classics We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage. It is a quick-playing, low-complexity game in that tradition. The game map is a world map of the period, whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT's other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one's cards and units given consistently limited resources? Event cards add detail and flavor to the game. They cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Arab-Israeli conflicts of 1948 and 1967, to Vietnam and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis and other such incidents that brought the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation.

Each player takes on the role of an aristocrat, originally controlling a small princedom. While playing they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers.\n\nThe game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom which is represented by the player board. Every tile has a function that starts when the tile is placed in the princedom. The princedom itself consists of several regions, each of which demands its own type of settlement tile.\n\nThe game is played in five phases, each consisting of five rounds.  Each phase begins with the game board stocked with settlement tiles and goods tiles.  At the beginning of each round all players roll their two dice, and the player who is currently first in turn order rolls a goods placement die.  A goods tile is made available on the game board according to the roll of the goods die.  During each round players take their turns in the current turn order.  During his turn, a player may perform any two of the four possible types of actions: 1) take a settlement tile from the numbered depot on the game board corresponding to one of his dice and place it in the staging area on his player board, 2) take a settlement tile from the staging area of his player board to a space on his player board with a number matching one of his dice in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent to a previously placed settlement tile, 3) deliver goods with a number matching one of his dice, or 4) take worker tokens which allow the player to adjust the roll of his dice.  In addition to these actions a player may buy a settlement tile from the central depot on the game board and place it in the staging area on his player board.  If an action triggers the award of victory points, those points are immediately recorded.  Each settlement tile offers a benefit, additional actions, additional money, advancement on the turn order track, more goods tiles, die roll adjustment or victory points.  Bonus victory points are awarded for filling a region with settlement tiles.\n\nThe game ends after the fifth phase is played to completion.  Victory points are awarded for unused money and workers, and undelivered goods.  Bonus victory points from certain settlement tiles are awarded at the end of the game.\n\nThe player with the most victory points wins.\n\nThe rules include basic and advanced versions.\n\nThis game is #14 in the Alea big box series.\n\nThere is a separate BGG entry for the 2019 edition: The Castles of Burgundy.  The 2019 edition includes, alongside the base game, eight expansions, seven of which had already been released separately as promotional items and one new to the 2019 release.\n\nUPC 4005556812431", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sH2YTQ10dHj1ibfS-KKtGA__small/img/f5zFXdTcH9RNY0iMNBppd8D-_r0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8745814.jpg", "complexity": 2.9734, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 4, "playing_time": 90, "categories": ["Animals", "Dice", "Medieval", "Territory Building"], "mechanics": ["Delayed Purchase", "Dice Rolling", "End Game Bonuses", "Grid Coverage", "Hexagon Grid", "Open Drafting", "Pattern Building", "Tile Placement", "Track Movement", "Turn Order: Stat-Based", "Variable Set-up"], "types": ["strategygames"], "bestwith": [2], "recommendedwith": [2, 3, 4], "pareto_rank": 3, "id": 84876}, {"name": "Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization", "yearpublished": 2015, "bayesaverage": 8.02335, "average": 8.2548, "usersrated": 34142, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/182028", "description": "Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization is the new edition of Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization, with many changes small and large to the game's cards over its three ages and extensive changes to how military works.\n\nThrough the Ages (TTA) is a civilization building game. Each player attempts to build the best civilization through careful resource management, and by: discovering new technologies, electing competent leaders, building wonders and maintaining a strong military. Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages, beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.\n\nOne of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is 'built' in the same manner as civilian buildings.

Each player takes on the role of an aristocrat, originally controlling a small princedom. While playing, they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers.\n\nThe game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom, which is represented by the player board. Every tile has a function that starts when the tile is placed in the princedom. The princedom itself consists of several regions, each of which demands its own type of settlement tile.\n\nThe game is played in five phases, each consisting of five rounds. Each phase begins with the game board stocked with settlement tiles and goods tiles. At the beginning of each round, all players roll their two dice, and the player who is currently first in turn order rolls a goods placement die. A goods tile is made available on the game board according to the roll of the goods die. During each round, players take their turns in the current turn order. During their turn, a player may perform any two of the four possible types of actions:\n\n\n    Take a settlement tile from the numbered depot on the game board corresponding to one of their dice and place it in the staging area on their player board.\n    Place a settlement tile from the staging area of their player board to a space on their player board with a number matching one of their dice in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent to a previously placed settlement tile.\n    Deliver goods with a number matching one of their dice.\n    Take worker tokens that allow the player to adjust the roll of their dice.\n\n\nIn addition to these actions, a player may buy a settlement tile from the central depot on the game board and place it in the staging area on their player board. If an action triggers the awarding of victory points, those points are immediately recorded. Each settlement tile offers a benefit: additional actions, additional money, advancement on the turn order track, more goods tiles, die roll adjustment or victory points. Bonus victory points are awarded for filling a region with settlement tiles.\n\nThe game ends when the last player finishes their turn of the fifth round of the fifth phase. Victory points are awarded for unused money and workers and for undelivered goods. Bonus victory points from certain settlement tiles are awarded at the end of the game. The player with the most victory points wins.\n\nThe 2019 edition of The Castles of Burgundy includes eight expansions, seven of which were previously released as promotional items and one new to this release (Shields).\nThis edition has one fewer double-sided Monastery boards than what came in The Castles of Burgundy: 4th Expansion \u2013 Monastery Boards.

The game is played over two halves: the canal phase and the rail phase. To win the game, score the most victory points (VPs), which are counted at the end of each phase. VPs are gained from your canals, rails, and established (flipped) industry tiles. Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following:\n\n\n    Build an industry tile\n    Build a rail or canal\n    Develop an industry\n    Sell cotton\n    Take a loan\n\n\nAt the end of your turn, you replace the two cards you played with two more from the deck.

This turn order mechanism opens some strategic options for players going later in the turn order, allowing for the possibility of back-to-back turns.\n\nAfter all the cards have been played the first time (with the deck size being adjusted for the number of players), the canal phase ends and a scoring round commences. After scoring, all canals and all of the lowest level industries are removed from the game, after which new cards are dealt and the rail phase begins.

Each player also starts with four wonder cards, and the construction of a wonder provides its owner with a special ability. Only seven wonders can be built, though, so one player will end up short.\n\nPlayers can purchase resources at any time from the bank, or they can gain cards during the game that provide them with resources for future building; as they are acquired, the cost for those resources increases for the opponent, representing the owner's dominance in this area.\n\nYou can win 7 Wonders Duel in one of three ways: each time you acquire a military card, you advance the military marker toward your opponent's capital (also giving you a bonus at certain positions). If you reach the opponent's capital, you win the game immediately. Or if you acquire six of seven different scientific symbols, you achieve scientific dominance and win immediately.

It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor.

Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction&rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place). Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.\n\nScythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player&rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness. Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources.

You are reliving the cultural achievements, mercantile expeditions, and pillages of those tribes we know as Viking today &mdash; a term that was used quite differently towards the end of the first millennium.\n\nWhen the northerners went out for a raid, they used to say they headed out for a viking. Their Scandinavian ancestors, however, were much more than just pirates. They were explorers and founders of states. Leif Eriksson is said to be the first European in America, long before Columbus.\nIn what is known today as Normandy, the intruders were not called Vikings but Normans. One of them is the famous William the Conqueror who invaded England in 1066. He managed to do what the king of Norway failed to do only a few years prior: conquer the Throne of England. The reason the people of these times became such strong seafarers was their unfortunate agricultural situation: crop shortfalls caused great distress.\n\nIn this game, you will raid and explore new territories. You will also engage in the day-to-day activity of collecting goods with which to achieve a financially secure position in society. In the end, the player whose possessions bear the greatest value will be declared the winner.\n\n--gameplay description from @StoryBoardGamer's review:\nA Feast for Odin is a points-driven game, with a plethora of pathways to victory, with a range of risks balanced against rewards. A significant portion of this is your central hall, which has a whopping -86 points of squares and a major part of your game is attempting to cover these up with various tiles. Likewise, long halls and island colonies can also offer large rewards, but they will have penalties of their own.\n\nEach year follows a familiar pattern of preparation, worker placement, and then meeting the requirements of your feast. The main phase of each year is a worker placement affair. You start with a selection of Vikings, and a large action board with a whopping 61 different options to choose from. Each of these will be arranged from left to right in one of four columns. Each column requires an additional Viking to activate, but they are proportionally more powerful.\n\nAt the end of each round, you will need to fill a feast table with food, alternating between plants and vegetable matter. You will also have a chance to lay the valuable green and blue tiles into your main hall. The configuration of these tiles must follow certain requirements, but your main goal is to both cover up a line of coin icons to increase your income, while otherwise encircling certain printed icons to generate those.\n\nYou will build your engine over time, following an alternating pattern of outward expansion and hunting against development and cultivation. It all comes down to how much you&rsquo;re willing to take on at any one time, and what risks you&rsquo;re willing to set yourself up with for their rewards.\n\nUPC 681706716909", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/s9oGMCo1fcfV4Dk3EnqLZw__small/img/AKxMMz2DTbBrEynhDROla8fdjJ4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3146943.png", "complexity": 3.8635, "min_players": 1, "max_players": 4, "playing_time": 120, "categories": ["Animals", "Farming", "Industry / Manufacturing", "Medieval", "Puzzle"], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Automatic Resource Growth", "Dice Rolling", "Enclosure", "Grid Coverage", "Hand Management", "Income", "Layering", "Pattern Recognition", "Push Your Luck", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Square Grid", "Tile Placement", "Turn Order: Pass Order", "Worker Placement"], "types": ["strategygames"], "bestwith": [3], "recommendedwith": [1, 2, 3, 4], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 177736}, {"name": "Clank!

You have your talents, sure, but you also have your flaws. Perhaps you've dabbled a little too much in the writings of the Necronomicon, and its words continue to haunt you. Perhaps you feel compelled to cover up any signs of otherworldly evils, hampering your own investigations in order to protect the quiet confidence of the greater population. Perhaps you'll be scarred by your encounters with a ghoulish cult.\n\nNo matter what compels you, no matter what haunts you, you'll find both your strengths and weaknesses reflected in your custom deck of cards, and these cards will be your resources as you work with your friends to unravel the world's most terrifying mysteries.\n\nEach of your adventures in Arkham Horror LCG carries you deeper into mystery. You'll find cultists and foul rituals. You'll find haunted houses and strange creatures. And you may find signs of the Ancient Ones straining against the barriers to our world...\n\nThe basic mode of play in Arkham LCG is not the adventure, but the campaign. You might be scarred by your adventures, your sanity may be strained, and you may alter Arkham's landscape, burning buildings to the ground. All your choices and actions have consequences that reach far beyond the immediate resolution of the scenario at hand&mdash;and your actions may earn you valuable experience with which you can better prepare yourself for the adventures that still lie before you.", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/B5F5ulz0UivNgrI9Ky0euA__small/img/L8ouPl5jv2Ye9MC4R_Os2zSGigE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3122349.jpg", "complexity": 3.5645, "min_players": 1, "max_players": 2, "playing_time": 120, "categories": ["Adventure", "Card Game", "Collectible Components", "Exploration", "Horror", "Novel-based"], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Area Movement", "Communication Limits", "Cooperative Game", "Deck Construction", "Events", "Hand Management", "Map Deformation", "Modular Board", "Player Elimination", "Push Your Luck", "Role Playing", "Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Stat Check Resolution", "Variable Player Powers"], "types": ["cgs", "thematic"], "bestwith": [2], "recommendedwith": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 205637}, {"name": "Root", "yearpublished": 2018, "bayesaverage": 7.88053, "average": 8.06863, "usersrated": 60987, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/237182", "description": "Root is a game of adventure and war in which 2 to 4 (1 to 6 with the 'Riverfolk' expansion, 2-6 with the 'Underworld', or 'Marauder' expansions) players battle for control of a vast wilderness.

Their visits (in the form of cards) are brief but can be very helpful.

A ring of posts is set around the inner circle, which functions as an obstacle to reach this area. Playing pieces are wooden circular disks similar to checkers pieces.  Players take turns shooting disks across the board by flicking them with their fingers in an effort to land them in the highest scoring ring on the board, the highest score (20 points) achieved by shooting a disk into the centre, recessed hole. From the outside in, rings are worth 5, 10, 15 points.\n\nAs a traditional game, there are often many variations played, but the following method is based on the National Crokinole Association's rules which also govern the World Crokinole Championship.\n\nEach disk to be shot must be placed on the outer boundary and within the shooting player's quadrant. If there are no opponent's disks on the board, the shot disk must land in the inner ring or it is removed. If there is an opponent's disk on the board, the shot disk must hit an opponent's piece, either directly, or by bumping another disk into it.  Disks landing in the centre hole are removed and scored at the end of the round. Disks that lie outside--or are touching--the outer boundary after each shot are removed from play for the round.\n\nThe player to score the most points wins the round and scores 2 points, and if a tie, each player scores 1 point. A \"game\" is usually played to four rounds. The number of \"games\" in a match is set by the tournament.\n\nAlternatively, play is to a set score, usually the first player or team to 100, and each round is scored by cancellation.

Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.\n\nThe resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.\n\nDuring each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as \"Trader\" or \"Builder\"). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the \"Builder\" role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.\n\nPuerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanism in which a \"governor\" token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.\n\nPlayers earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned \"large buildings.\" Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.\n\nIn 2011 and mostly afterwards, Puerto Rico was published to include both Puerto Rico: Expansion I &ndash; New Buildings and Puerto Rico: Expansion II &ndash; The Nobles. These versions are included in the other game entry Puerto Rico, not this regular game entry for Puerto Rico.

The first settlers arrived on Mars in the year 2037 and in the decades after establishment of Mars Base Camp, private exploration companies began work on the creation of a self-sustaining colony. As chief astronaut for one of these enterprises, you want to be a pioneer in the development of the biggest, most advanced colony on Mars by achieving both D.O.M.E. mission goals as well as your company&rsquo;s private agenda.  In the beginning, you will be dependent on supplies from Earth and will have to travel often between the Mars Space Station and the planet's surface. As the colony expands over time, you will shift your activities to construct mines, power generators, water extractors, greenhouses, oxygen factories, and shelters. Your goal is to develop a self-sustaining colony independent of any terrestrial organization. This will require understanding the importance of water, air, power, and food &mdash; the necessities for survival. Do you dare take part in humankind&rsquo;s biggest challenge?\n\nOn Mars is played over several rounds, each consisting of two phases - the Colonization Phase \u200band the Shuttle Phase\u200b.\n\nDuring the Colonization Phase, each player takes a turn during which they take actions. The available actions depend on the side of the board they are on. If you are in orbit, you can take blueprints, buy and develop technologies, and take supplies from the Warehouse. If you are on the surface of the planet, you can construct buildings with your bots, upgrade these buildings using blueprints, take scientists and new contracts, welcome new ships, and explore the planet&rsquo;s surface with your rover. In the Shuttle Phase, players may travel between the colony and the Space Station in orbit.\n\nAll buildings on Mars have a dependency on each other and some are required for the colony to grow. Building shelters for Colonists to live in requires oxygen; generating oxygen requires plants; growing plants requires water; extracting water from ice requires power; generating power requires mining minerals; and mining minerals requires Colonists. Upgrading the colony&rsquo;s ability to provide each of these resources is vital. As the colony grows, more shelters are needed so that the Colonists can survive the inhospitable conditions on Mars.\n\nDuring the game, players are also trying to complete missions. Once a total of three missions have been completed, the game ends. To win the game, players must contribute to the development of the first colony on Mars.

It contains new opportunities like butchering, elk-hunting, fishing, and thievery, along with changes for some old actions. It's now easier, for example, to play an animal strategy, because you can now get two of the same animals in one action. There is also a new fifth column with (better) actions that require only one viking. For example, you can now forge a grey special tile with a sword value of 8 or less by using an ore and only one viking! Another totally new 1-viking action is to do a \"small emigration\" using a whaling boat, which covers one space at the banquet table instead of two but is worth 7VP and costs no silver to do so. And as a bonus, you can send two vikings to this column instead of one to play an occupation card in addition to the action. The catch is, once you use an action from the fifth column, you can't place any more vikings for the rest of this round.\n\nNew puzzle-tiles: 2x5 rectangle (horse/pregnant horse/leather/vadmal) and 5 spaces in a \"U\" shape (herbs/pig/antlers/tools). The red versions of these tiles feature two new animals, horses (worth 6VP) and pigs (worth 1VP and breed every round as opposed to every other round) respectively, adding yet more paths for an animal strategy. There are also five new grey special tiles such as a pan, a hauberk and an anvil, most of which can be forged with ore. Also included is a third goods box to hold all the new tiles.\n\nFour new exploration boards: Islands on the frontside (Isle of Man, Isle of Skye, Islay, Outer Hebrides) with Irish coastal viking-settlements on the backside (Waterford, Wexford, Cork, Limerick), where people from Norway came to stay through the winter, to trade at, and to settle nearby. Also included are renewed versions of the four exploration boards from the base game, with updated iconography and some with adjusted VPs.\n\nNew buildings: Also totally new is the idea of a random start-building. Everybody gets one of the six double-sided \"artisan shed\" boards, and whenever a player could build a shed during the game, they may instead build the front or backside of their artisan shed. Just like the stonehouse and longhouse, the artisan sheds offer new spaces to place orange and red tiles to earn bonus goods, silver and VP, and many of them require specific tiles to be placed in specific spaces. So everybody has another different start-opportunity - like the occupation cards.\n\nVP tokens: Another new option is that, whenever a player would play an occupation card into the game, the player may instead discard the card for a VP token, which are worth 4, 3 or 2VP at the end of the game. A nice little competitive element, as there are a limited number of the 4VP and 3VP tokens.\n\nOther stuff: The expansion also includes another mountain strip, more two-silver coins and more beans/mead and oil/runestone tiles.\n\nThe expansion includes another almanac about the new game-elements and their viking-history.

Earth is recovering from a catastrophic explosion that exterminated the majority of the population centuries ago and made most of the surface uninhabitable due to unearthly weather conditions. The surviving humans organized along four radically different ideologies, called Paths, to rebuild the world as they see fit: Harmony, Dominance, Progress, and Salvation. Followers of the four Paths live in a fragile peace, but in almost complete isolation next to each other. Their only meeting point is the last major city on Earth, now just known as the Capital.\n\nBy powering up the mysterious Time Rifts that opened in the wake of the cataclysm, each Path is able to reach back to specific moments in their past. Doing so can greatly speed up their progress, but too much meddling may endanger the time-space continuum. But progress is more important than ever before: if the mysterious message arriving through the Time Rift is to be believed, an even more terrible cataclysm is looming on the horizon: an asteroid bearing the mysterious substance called Neutronium is heading towards Earth. Even stranger, the scientists show that the energy signature of the asteroid matches the explosion centuries ago...\n\nAnachrony features a unique two-tiered worker placement system. To travel to the Capital or venture out to the devastated areas for resources, players need not only various specialists (Engineers, Scientists, Administrators, and Geniuses) but also Exosuits to protect and enhance them &mdash; and both are in short supply.\n\nThe game is played in 4-7 turns, depending on the time when the looming cataclysm occurs &mdash; unless, of course, it is averted!

Ragnar&ouml;k has come and it&rsquo;s the end of the world! It&rsquo;s the Vikings&rsquo; last chance to go down in a blaze of glory and secure their places in Valhalla at Odin&rsquo;s side! As a Viking you can pursue one of many pathways to glory. You can: invade and pillage the land for its rewards; crush your opponents in battle: fulfill quests: increase your clan's stats: or even die gloriously in battle or from Ragnar&ouml;k, the ultimate inescapable doom.\n\nMost player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages). These &ldquo;Gods&rsquo; Gifts&rdquo; grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having many of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle. Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises. Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles or punishes the winner.\n\nPlayers must choose their strategies carefully during the draft phase, but also be ready to adapt and react to their opponents&rsquo; strategies as the action phase unfolds. Battles are decided not only by the strength of the figures involved but also by cards played in secret. By observing your opponent&rsquo;s actions and allegiances to specific gods you may predict what card they are likely to play, and plan accordingly. Winning battles is not always the best course of action, as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed.

For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof. Aftermarket decks such as the Z-Deck and the L-Deck also exist. Each player starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit into his/her strategy.\n\nAgricola is a turn-based game, and the problem to be overcome is that each available action can be taken by only one player each round so it's important to be careful about your choices.

When night falls, the lanterns are lit and the workers return to their clan.\n\nIn The White Castle, players will control one of these clans in order to score more victory points than the rest. To do so, they must amass influence in the court, manage resources boldly, and place their workers in the right place at the right time. The authors are Sheila Santos and Israel Cendrero, the duo known as Llama Dice who also designed the successful The Red Cathedral with Devir. In this case, we leave the Moscow of Ivan the Terrible behind to explore the most imposing fortress in modern Japan, Himeji Castle, where the banner of the Sakai clan flies under the orders of Daimyo Sakai Tadakiyo.\n\nThe White Castle is a Euro type game with mechanics of resource management, worker placement and dice placement to carry out actions. During the game, over three rounds, players will send members of their clan to tend the gardens, defend the castle or progress up the social ladder of the nobility. At the end of the match, these will award players victory points in a variety of ways.\n\nThe central panel shows Himeji Castle in all its splendor, divided into several zones. The largest is inside the castle, with the Room of the Thousand Carpets, where the courtiers must ascend socially until they reach the circle closest to the Daimyo to enjoy his favor. There is also the pond and the gardens, patiently tended by the gardeners where everyone can relax and contemplate its beauty without restriction. Another important area is the wall and the outside of the castle, where the warriors patrol and stand guard. Finally, we find the area of the three bridges, where the three types of dice that can be used to carry out actions are accumulated, and the personal domain of each player, where they will keep track of their resources and where they will have the reserve of workers.\n\nWith accessible rules and a very careful setting, The White Castle is a very versatile title that will fit in with different gaming groups.

A Demon is on the loose, murdering by night and disguised in human form by day. Some have scraps of information. Others have abilities that fight the evil or protect the innocent. But the Demon and its evil minions are spreading lies to confuse and breed suspicion. Will the good townsfolk put the puzzle together in time to execute the true demon and save themselves?

The goal of the game is to successfully deduce and execute the demons before they outnumber the townfolk.\n\nDuring a 'day' phase players socialize openly and whisper privately to trade knowledge or spread lies, culminating in a player's execution if a majority suspects them of being Evil. During a 'night' time, players close their eyes and are woken one at a time by the Storyteller to gather information, spread mischief, or kill.\n\nThe Storyteller uses the game's intricate playing pieces to guide each game, leaving others free to play without a table or board.

One player commands the seemingly limitless armies of the Galactic Empire, threatening to extinguish the flame of the Rebellion forever. Up to four other players become heroes of the Rebel Alliance, engaging in covert operations to undermine the Empire&rsquo;s schemes. Over the course of the campaign, both the Imperial player and the Rebel heroes gain new experience and skills, allowing characters to evolve as the story unfolds.\n\nImperial Assault offers a different game experience in the skirmish game.

You&rsquo;ll gather your own strike force of Imperials, Rebels, and Mercenaries and build a deck of command cards to gain an unexpected advantage in the heat of battle.

They serve as the corporation's virtual eyes, ears, and machine guns on the sprawling information superhighways of the network.\n\nIn turn, runners need to spend their time and credits acquiring a sufficient wealth of resources, purchasing the necessary hardware, and developing suitably powerful ice-breaker programs to hack past corporate security measures. Their jobs are always a little desperate, driven by tight timelines, and shrouded in mystery. When a runner jacks-in and starts a run at a corporate server, he risks having his best programs trashed or being caught by a trace program and left vulnerable to corporate countermeasures. It's not uncommon for an unprepared runner to fail to bypass a nasty sentry and suffer massive brain damage as a result. Even if a runner gets through a data fort's defenses, there's no telling what it holds. Sometimes, the runner finds something of value. Sometimes, the best he can do is work to trash whatever the corporation was developing.\n\nThe first player to seven points wins the game, but not likely before he suffers some brain damage or bad publicity.\n\nThe Revised Core Set for Android: Netrunner released in late 2017 includes cards from the original Core Set released in 2012 as well as cards from the Genesis Cycle and Spin Cycle series of Data Packs.

How, when, and where you dis-place these Five Tribes of Assassins, Elders, Builders, Merchants, and Viziers determine your victory or failure.\n\nAs befitting a Days of Wonder game, the rules are straightforward and easy to learn. But devising a winning strategy will take a more calculated approach than our standard fare. You need to carefully consider what moves can score you well and put your opponents at a disadvantage. You need to weigh many different pathways to victory, including the summoning of powerful Djinns that may help your cause as you attempt to control this legendary Sultanate.", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dmo-WD6HZHVUPrbVHunaTw__small/img/I6KVJlQgS1GfWDPSWAFNqce4Cgc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2055255.jpg", "complexity": 2.8378, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 4, "playing_time": 80, "categories": ["Arabian", "Fantasy", "Mythology"], "mechanics": ["Auction / Bidding", "Constrained Bidding", "End Game Bonuses", "Hidden Victory Points", "Mancala", "Modular Board", "Set Collection", "Square Grid", "Take That", "Turn Order: Auction", "Variable Player Powers", "Variable Set-up", "Victory Points as a Resource"], "types": ["strategygames"], "bestwith": [2], "recommendedwith": [2, 3, 4], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 157354}, {"name": "Wingspan Asia", "yearpublished": 2022, "bayesaverage": 7.60922, "average": 8.22532, "usersrated": 9144, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/366161", "description": "Wingspan: Asia introduces the diverse and vibrant birds of the Asian continent.

During this time, they brought stunning technological innovation and scientific advancements to their domain. This accelerated progression helped the Domineum reach &mdash; and eventually inhabit &mdash; even the farthest segments of the known galaxy, where new Houses emerged to govern the outer sectors of the empire. As the House of Novarchon grew in power, so grew the religious cult that surrounded them, proclaiming grim prophecies about an ancient cosmic being from another dimension: the Voidborn.\n\nMany thought it to be only a myth, but in truth, it was the Voidborn's dark influence that granted the Novarchs the sheer knowledge to achieve rapid expansion for the empire. While the cult of the Novarchs envisaged eternal life through the otherworldly entity, the Voidborn's only intention was satiating its eternal hunger. And so, when the Domineum had achieved a vastness fitting the Voidborn's craving, interdimensional rifts opened at the heart of the Domineum to unleash cosmic corruption. As the House of Novarchon and its followers welcomed the Voidborn and sought their false salvation, the entity infected and spread and seized control over the inner worlds. Now, it is time for the remaining Great Houses to purge the galactic corruption, prevent the Voidborn from fully manifesting in our dimension, and to ultimately overcome the chaos as the new rulers of the Domineum.\n\nVoidfall is a space 4X game that brings the genre to Euro enthusiasts' tables. It combines the tension, player interaction, and deep empire customization of the 4X genre with the resource management, tight decisions, and minimum-luck gameplay of an economic Euro. Win by pushing back the Voidborn in the solo/coop mode, or by overcoming your rivals' influence in restoring the Domineum in the competitive mode &mdash; both using the same rule set and game system. Variability is ensured not only by multiple playable houses with their own strengths and weaknesses, but also by many different map set-ups for all game modes.\n\nAs the leader of a defiant Great House, you play through three cycles, each with a game-altering galactic event, a new scoring condition, and a set number of focus cards that can be played. Focus card decisions and sequencing is the centerpiece of the gameplay. By selecting two of their three impactful actions as you play them, you develop and improve techs; advance on your three house-specific civilization tracks; manage your sectors' infrastructure, population, and production; and conquer new sectors with up to five different types of space fleets. Space battles are fought either against the Voidborn's infected forces (which are present as neutral opponents even in the competitive mode) or against other players. Instead of relying on the luck of a die roll, battles in Voidfall are fully deterministic and reward careful preparation and outsmarting your opponents.\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hItZjdDTNuaCZ7fEztwcUQ__small/img/Ov6eWR87PZ2O1XYQtXMO6KvfzOg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6153324.jpg", "complexity": 4.5944, "min_players": 1, "max_players": 4, "playing_time": 240, "categories": ["Civilization", "Economic", "Science Fiction", "Space Exploration"], "mechanics": ["Command Cards", "Cooperative Game", "Events", "Grid Movement", "Hand Management", "Hexagon Grid", "Modular Board", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Variable Player Powers"], "types": ["strategygames"], "bestwith": [1], "recommendedwith": [1, 2, 3, 4], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 337627}, {"name": "Clank!: A Deck-Building Adventure", "yearpublished": 2016, "bayesaverage": 7.60138, "average": 7.76547, "usersrated": 46279, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/201808", "description": "Burgle your way to adventure in the deck-building board game Clank!

Construct dikes to keep the waters at bay and expand your fields. Dry out bogs to harvest peat and then clear the land for cultivation. Create more fields for your livestock, buildings, or future crops; after that, you can decide whether to house animals or cultivate a forest for timber. Perhaps you&rsquo;d like to take up some flax farming for yourself, or diversify and try out a little bit of everything.\n\nTools of the Trade\nAt the outset of each half year, you&rsquo;ll choose how you&rsquo;d like to spend that time working. There are many ways to build your fortune. Use the Master space to increase the tools at your disposal, focus on the Cattle Trainer to make the most of your livestock, or build up your fleet of vehicles and ship out goods. Taking stock of your progress differs depending on the season. You may milk your existing livestock or care for a bunch of newborn animals. You could harvest your flax in the fall, and shear your sheep in spring. At the end of each half year, you&rsquo;ll need to take stock of your progress by unloading your vehicles and feeding your family and animals, so keep an eye on the season and do your best to keep the farm growing and everyone well fed!\n\nTravel and Prosper\nOnce you&rsquo;ve made headway in clearing fields and stocking up goods, it's time to make your products available to potential buyers. The more vehicles you have, the more goods you can ship. Send things into the wide world to increase your Travel Experience and grant you points over the course of the four and a half years of the game.

They are striving for fortune and fame in a competition hosted by a legendary magician, looking for a successor worthy of the mighty Trickerion Stone, which is fabled to grant supernatural power to its owner.\n\nUsing worker placement and simultaneous action selection mechanisms, the Illusionists and their teams of helpers &mdash; the Engineer, the Assistant, the Manager, and a handful of Apprentices &ndash; obtain blueprints and components for increasingly complex magic tricks, expand the team and set up performances by visiting the Downtown, Dark Alley, Market Row and Theater locations on the main game board depicting a late 19th century cityscape.\n\nThe tricks are stored and prepared on the Magician's own Workshop game board, while the performances themselves take place at the Theater in the form of a tile placement mini-game with lots of player interaction. The performances yield Fame points and Coins to their owners based on the tricks they consist of. Fame points have multiple uses, but they also serve as a win condition - After turn 7, when the last Performance card is revealed, the game ends and the illusionist with the most Fame points wins.\n\nThe game offers 48 different Tricks to be learned from the Optical, Spiritual, Mechanical and Escape categories, over 90 character abilities, and 40 Special Assignment cards that influence the actions taken at the various game locations. The base game can be expanded with two optional rule modules to add further strategic depth to the game.\n\nThe \"Dark Alley\" expansion included in the base game adds a new location to the game.

Players can try to achieve one of three different victory conditions:\n\n\n     Leadership: Be the leader &mdash; i.e., have more clan figures than any other player &mdash; of territories containing at least six opponents' clans.\n     Land: Have your clans present in at least six different territories.\n     Religion: Have your clans present in territories that collectively contain at least six sanctuaries.\n\n\nAt the start of each round, players draft a hand of four action cards during the Assembly. Action cards not played at the end of one season are not held for the next. Players also have access to leader cards for the territories that allow it and where they were elected leader during the assembly. Each Assembly reallocates those cards. Finally, they collect \"epic tales\" cards that depict the deeds of the ancient Irish gods and heroes, like Cuchulainn, the Dagda, Lugh and many others. These will be kept and used to inspire the clans and achieve extraordinary feats under the right circumstances. The cards provide a variety of actions: adding clans, moving clans, building/exploring, and special actions. Over the course of the game, players also earn deeds, that reduce by one the total for any Victory condition.\n\nCareful drafting, hand management, bluffing (especially once players understand the importance of passing their turn), good timing, and a precise understanding of the balance of power are the keys to victory. After a discovery game you'll be ready for a full and epic game, where an undisputed player will be king by the Assembly for his merit and wisdom.\n\nWhile Inis has \"dudes\" that are \"on a map\", it's a beginner's mistake to play this as a battle game because eliminating other clans reduces your chances of scoring a Leadership victory condition. Peace among different clans, with or without a clear territory leader, is the usual outcome of a clan's movement. Battles will occur, of course, as the Celtic clans can be unruly and a good player will listen to his clan's people (i.e., his hand of cards). That battle aspect is reflected in the clan's miniatures representing warriors. Woodsmen, shepherds and traders complete the set of twelve minis for each player; these occupations have no impact on the game, but give it flavor.", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6QE8mnPFmauoj2THsyUYPA__small/img/m63hnvHi6jqlva52FGaWbEqzjys=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4739757.jpg", "complexity": 2.944, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 4, "playing_time": 90, "categories": ["Ancient", "Card Game", "Exploration", "Mythology", "Wargame"], "mechanics": ["Action Drafting", "Area Majority / Influence", "Area Movement", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Closed Drafting", "Hand Management", "Hexagon Grid", "Interrupts", "King of the Hill", "Map Addition", "Modular Board", "Take That", "Variable Set-up"], "types": ["strategygames"], "bestwith": [4], "recommendedwith": [2, 3, 4], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 155821}, {"name": "Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game", "yearpublished": 2008, "bayesaverage": 7.52864, "average": 7.72941, "usersrated": 37391, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/37111", "description": "Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game is an exciting game of mistrust, intrigue, and the struggle for survival.

Each playable character has their own abilities and weaknesses, and must all work together in order for humanity to have any hope of survival. However, one or more players in every game secretly side with the Cylons. Players must attempt to expose the traitor while fuel shortages, food contaminations, and political unrest threatens to tear the fleet apart.\n\nAfter the Cylon attack on the Colonies, the battered remnants of the human race are on the run, constantly searching for the next signpost on the road to Earth.

Humanity must work together if they are to have any hope of survival&hellip;but how can they, when any of them may, in fact, be a Cylon agent?\n\nBattlestar Galactica: The Board Game is a semi-cooperative game for 3-6 players ages 10 and up that can be played in 2-3 hours. Players choose from pilots, political leaders, military leaders, or engineers to crew Galactica. They are also dealt a loyalty card at the start of the game to determine if they are a human or Cylon along with an assortment of skill cards based on their characters abilities. Players then can move and take actions either on Galactica, on Colonial 1, or in a Viper. They need to collect skill cards, fend off Cylon ships, and keep Galactica and the fleet jumping. Each turn also brings a Crisis Card, various tasks that players must overcome. Players need to play matching skill cards to fend off the problems; skill cards that don't match hinder the players success. Fate could be working against the crew, or there could be a traitorous Cylon! As players get closer and closer towards reaching their Earth, another round of loyalty cards are passed out and more Cylons may turn up. If players can keep their up their food stores, fuel levels, ship morale, and population, and they can keep Galactica in one piece long enough to make it to Earth, the Humans win the game. But if the Cylon players reveal themselves at the right moment and bring down Galactica, the Humans have lost.\n\nOfficial Site, Rules & FAQ: http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=18&esem=4\nUnofficial FAQ for really tricky questions: http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Battlestar_Galactica_FAQ", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5Q2w2rFJiFI_uV89KP6ECg__small/img/s1BljxEdoxQ1zGYiw05Qa9rg9hI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic354500.jpg", "complexity": 3.2507, "min_players": 3, "max_players": 6, "playing_time": 180, "categories": ["Bluffing", "Deduction", "Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Political", "Science Fiction", "Space Exploration", "Spies / Secret Agents"], "mechanics": ["Area Movement", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Hidden Roles", "Once-Per-Game Abilities", "Role Playing", "Semi-Cooperative Game", "Team-Based Game", "Traitor Game", "Variable Player Powers", "Variable Set-up", "Voting"], "types": ["thematic"], "bestwith": [5], "recommendedwith": [4, 5, 6], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 37111}, {"name": "Ra", "yearpublished": 1999, "bayesaverage": 7.52839, "average": 7.69237, "usersrated": 30397, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12", "description": "Ra is an auction and set-collection game with an Ancient Egyptian theme.

Workers of matching colors are used by the players to bid for tiles to add to their villages.

It is during the Encounter Phase of each turn that players resolve combat or, alternatively, build their investigators' personal stories by reading an encounter narrative from one of several types of Encounter cards. You might go head to head with a monster in Istanbul or find yourself in a tough spot with the crime syndicate in a major city. Maybe you will embark on an expedition to the Pyramids or research a clue you uncover in the unnamed wilderness. You may even find your way through a gate and explore a dimension beyond time and space.\n\nShould you fail an encounter, the cost is steep. If you are fortunate, you will merely incur physical or mental trauma.

You could find yourself getting in over your head to acquire assets and receive a Debt condition &ndash; or maybe you'll owe a favor to something far more insidious than a debt collector, and enter into a Dark Pact! Whatever your condition, you would be wise to find a resolution with haste; many conditions have a \"reckoning effect\" which, if triggered, ensure a much more sinister fate.\n\nAll the while, the arrival of the Ancient One approaches.

Each round players choose action cards from their hand, place them face down in the so-called action slot (beneath the player board), and then reveal them simultaneously to carry out the actions. At the end of the action phase, each card is moved to the so-called resting slot (above the player board). Cards in the resting slots are inactive and cannot be used until they are recovered - each round one can only return cards of one resting slot which is why it can make quite a difference in which action slots certain cards are placed.\n\nThe game ends after seven rounds, players add up their scores in different categories, and the player with the highest score (who has earned the most money) wins the game.

If your time token is behind or on top of the other player's time token, then you take another turn; otherwise the opponent now goes.

Players take the roles of ancient galactic civilizations, each seeking to seize the imperial throne via warfare, diplomacy, and technological progression. With geomorphic board tiles, exquisite plastic miniatures, hundreds of cards, and introducing a rich set of strategic dimensions that allows each player to refocus their game-plan, the original designer (Christian T. Petersen) has seamlessly incorporated the better qualities of other recently popular games to improve on the game-play of the original TI, making it at once perfectly well-rounded and pleasantly familiar to experienced gamers.\n\nTI3 is played by at least three players who belong to ten possible alien races, each with their own advantages and quirks. The 'designer notes' in the rulebook candidly and humbly acknowledge the inspiration for some of the improvements to the original game. The strategic game-play borrows the governing element from Puerto Rico to involve players in an iteratively complex and yet fast-paced game experience with very little downtime. The game map, basic player progress and overall victory are dynamically determined in almost exactly the same way as they are by imaginative players of CATAN, while the \"Command\" system cleverly improves on the 'oil' logistical mechanism of Attack! to both manage turn-based activity and limit the size of armies, uniquely enabling weakened players to bounce back if they play their cards right.\n\n\nPart of the Twilight Imperium Series.\n\nRe-implements:\n\n    Twilight Imperium: Second Edition\n\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    Twilight Imperium: Third Edition \u2013 Shattered Empire\n    Twilight Imperium: Third Edition \u2013 Shards of the Throne\n\n\nRe-implemented in:\n\n    Twilight Imperium: Fourth Edition", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MHeQQrbauUVsvh2QF6PMog__small/img/9dc8SjfrB38KrNsuHd_JZOXnwYk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4128153.jpg", "complexity": 4.2587, "min_players": 3, "max_players": 6, "playing_time": 240, "categories": ["Civilization", "Negotiation", "Political", "Science Fiction", "Space Exploration", "Wargame"], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Area-Impulse", "Dice Rolling", "Follow", "Grid Movement", "Hexagon Grid", "Increase Value of Unchosen Resources", "Modular Board", "Player Elimination", "Tech Trees / Tech Tracks", "Tile Placement", "Trading", "Variable Phase Order", "Variable Player Powers", "Voting"], "types": ["thematic", "strategygames"], "bestwith": [6], "recommendedwith": [4, 5, 6], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 12493}, {"name": "7 Wonders: Leaders", "yearpublished": 2011, "bayesaverage": 7.46899, "average": 7.81585, "usersrated": 15167, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/92539", "description": "7 Wonders: Leaders adds 42 new cards to the base game of 7 Wonders, comprising four new guilds, one new wonder card, and 36 (+1 blank) white \"Leader\" cards.

Newer locomotives cover greater distances and factories churn out improved technology. Engineers, when used effectively, can be the extra boost that an empire needs to race past the competition.\n\nThere are many paths to victory: Who will ride into the future full steam ahead and who will be run off the rails? Whose empire will overcome the challenges ahead and emerge victorious?\n\n\nGame Summary\nEach player has their own board, with space for factories, and 3 rail tracks (to 3 different cities). On each track, use a track token to mark the progression of your rails (different colored marker for each type or rail). Some interesting twists:\n- The different track types must be built in a specific order (black, gray, brown, natural, white). Later tracks may never be advanced further on the track than the earlier tracks.\n- On each track, as the track head advances, you cross several thresholds that provide awards: the ability to start a new color of track, victory points, bonus tiles, etc.\n- Each track line can have one (two for the first rail) engine(s) associated with it; the size of the loco(s) determines how far down the track you actually score VP.\n\nThe central board has (almost) all the locations for placing workers. Each location requires 1-3 workers (of one player; played all together). Players, who start the game with 5 workers (or 6 workers, in 2-3 player games), will take turns using a location. These provide a variety of abilities, for example:\n- advance 1 or more track heads by 1-3 spaces\n- acquire an engine or factory; engines are allocated to rail lines, while factories (the reverse side of the tile) are placed on your factory line.\n- earn 2 coins\n- take 2 temporary workers\n- jump ahead in turn order\n- acquire an engineer, which has a unique power and becomes a worker-placement location only for you\n\nEach round ends when all players have passed on placing/using workers. Then, score VP for each track and factory line. On each track line, only spaces as far down the track as the loco level will score. Each track type scores VP for every space from its track head back to where the next color of track starts. Track types built earlier (e.g. black) score less/space than later tracks (e.g., white). On each factory line the position of the purple industry marker(s) show how many VP are scored.\n\nAfter 7 rounds (or 6 rounds, in 2-3 player games), the game ends; most VP wins!", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/B0oEVgeqs4_rT8oyb1_Juw__small/img/oZkHYUMtcGVwg_gz6OjtuiD3vmU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1772936.jpg", "complexity": 3.3973, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 4, "playing_time": 120, "categories": ["Industry / Manufacturing", "Trains"], "mechanics": ["End Game Bonuses", "Tech Trees / Tech Tracks", "Turn Order: Claim Action", "Worker Placement"], "types": ["strategygames"], "bestwith": [4], "recommendedwith": [2, 3, 4], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 144733}, {"name": "Nucleum", "yearpublished": 2023, "bayesaverage": 7.45859, "average": 8.12122, "usersrated": 7452, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/396790", "description": "When Elsa von Fr&uuml;hlingsfeld presented her invention to King Frederik Augustus II of Saxony, people thought it was trickery.

In the operations phase, players reveal their tokens to:\n\n\n     Dominate, draining friendly planets of their important resources\n     Strategize, purchasing cards that can upgrade their orders and combat abilities\n     Deploy, building cities, factories, bastions, and new mobile units\n     Advance, moving units and attacking their enemies.\n\n\nThe last phase of each round is the refresh phase, during which players profit from the planets they control, reveal event cards to move the impassable Warp Storms, and heal any units wounded in battle.\n\nBecause of the game's three-phase structure, strategy in Forbidden Stars is balanced between short-term bluffing and long-term tactical military action. The game's set-up also poses strategic opportunities. Players start the game by taking turns assembling sections of the Herakon Cluster, placing individual system tiles along with their own starting forces and the enemy objectives that they must defend. This intentional construction, along with the unique domination abilities of the game's four factions, means that players must work to best utilize their own force's strengths while exploiting the weaknesses of their opponents.", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WlvyznYhlYNXMtMbKKu1oA__small/img/cudczHrJs0wFKywIHBQ6Fb7D7oY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2471359.jpg", "complexity": 3.8444, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 4, "playing_time": 180, "categories": ["Bluffing", "Fighting", "Science Fiction", "Wargame"], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Area Movement", "Card Play Conflict Resolution", "Deck, Bag, and Pool Building", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Modular Board", "Order Counters", "Variable Player Powers"], "types": ["strategygames"], "bestwith": [3], "recommendedwith": [2, 3, 4], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 175155}, {"name": "Just One", "yearpublished": 2018, "bayesaverage": 7.43971, "average": 7.59801, "usersrated": 33245, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/254640", "description": "Just One is a co-operative party game in which you all play together to get the best score!

Your deck of cards represents all the weapons in your arsenal. It contains the spells you know and the creatures you can summon to fight for you.\n\nThis is the grandfather of the collectible card game (or CCG) genre.  Cards are categorized as common, uncommon, rare, and mythic rare.  Players collect cards and build decks out of their collection.\n\nPlayers build a deck of cards and duel against an opponent's deck.  Players are wizards attempting to reduce their opponent's life total to zero.  The first player to reduce his opponent's life to zero (or meet another set win condition) wins the game.\n\nAn important part of the game is deck construction, which is done prior to the actual game by selecting what cards are included in a particular deck.  There are over 25,000 different cards from which to build your deck!\n\nCards can be lands, which usually generate mana of various colors, or spells, which require a certain amount of mana to be used.  Some cards (creatures, artifacts, and enchantments) stay on the board and continue to affect the game, while others have a one-time effect.\n\nPlayers randomly draw spells to see what they get and can play each turn.  Although this limits your choices, there is a lot of strategy in how you play those spells.  A robust list of game mechanics, including intricate rules for reactive card play called \"the stack,\" provide for rich tactics and tough choices each turn.\n\nThough traditionally a two-player duel, there are several casual and tournament formats to Magic that allow more players to play.", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CxJmNl4wR4InjqyNrMdBTw__small/img/TtlQgYxLTPyYQWJvruMHfwKPReE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic163749.jpg", "complexity": 3.2819, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 6, "playing_time": 20, "categories": ["Card Game", "Collectible Components", "Fantasy", "Fighting"], "mechanics": ["Betting and Bluffing", "Closed Drafting", "Deck Construction", "Hand Management", "Income", "Interrupts", "Player Elimination", "Tags", "Take That"], "types": ["cgs"], "bestwith": [2], "recommendedwith": [2, 3, 4], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 463}, {"name": "PARKS", "yearpublished": 2019, "bayesaverage": 7.40871, "average": 7.62893, "usersrated": 29680, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/266524", "description": "PARKS is a celebration of the US National Parks featuring illustrious art from Fifty-Nine Parks.\n\nIn PARKS, players will take on the role of two hikers as they trek through different trails across four seasons of the year.

They run the household and they have the last word at home in the tents. Different families are divided into tribes, headed by the &lsquo;Imascheren&rsquo; (or nobles). As leader of a Tuareg tribe, players trade goods from near (such as dates and salt) and far (like pepper), in order to obtain gold and other benefits, and enlarge their family. In each round their new offerings are made. Cards are a means to an end, in order to obtain the popular tribe cards.\n\nThe board consists of a 5x5 grid: a border of 16 squares with printed action symbols and then 9 blank squares in the centre onto which cards are dealt. Meeples are placed one at a time on the spaces at the edges of the board (not including corner squares). You cannot place a meeple on a square the opponent has a meeple on already, nor on a square facing opponent's meeple. Once all meeples are placed, players then execute the actions on the border squares the meeples are on and also take the cards from the centre that match the row and column of the border meeples.\n\nThe game is predominantly scored and won by playing tribal cards to your display. These give advantages during the game and victory points at the end. Usually cards are played (or discarded) immediately once drawn. A single card can be kept in hand but then requires a special action to play it (or to discard it to free the hand spot for another card). Each card has a cost in goods to play. Goods are obtained either from border spaces or from goods cards.\n\nThe display (for scoring) consists of 3 rows of 4 cards that are filled from left to right and cannot be moved once placed (barring some special cards). There is also a balance to be found between the victory point score on the cards themselves (1-3 VP per tribal card) and in the combinations per row (a full row of 4 identical card types gets you an additional 4 VP, and a full row of 4 distinct card types gets you 2 VP).\n\nThe winner at the end of the game is the player with the most victory points.", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wHg4fOf48cs1kw1PDOk1tQ__small/img/6l-jqYlfECK1SVSsUs7FXUheKzQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3958793.jpg", "complexity": 2.3439, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 2, "playing_time": 60, "categories": ["Arabian", "Card Game"], "mechanics": ["End Game Bonuses", "Modular Board", "Open Drafting", "Set Collection", "Square Grid", "Turn Order: Progressive", "Worker Placement"], "types": ["strategygames"], "bestwith": [2], "recommendedwith": [2], "pareto_rank": 7, "id": 118048}, {"name": "Star Realms", "yearpublished": 2014, "bayesaverage": 7.40394, "average": 7.55396, "usersrated": 47294, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/147020", "description": "Star Realms is a spaceship combat deck-building game by Magic Hall of Famers Darwin Kastle (The Battle for Hill 218) and Rob Dougherty (Ascension Co-designer). It combines the fun of a deck-building game with the speed and interactivity of Trading Card Game style combat. In Star Realms, players make use of Ships and Bases to generate Trade to acquire new Ships and Bases or to generate Combat to attack their opponent to reduce their Authority or destroy their Bases. When you reduce your opponent&rsquo;s Authority to zero, you win!\n\nThe Ships and Bases in Star Realms come in four factions. You may acquire and use cards of any faction, but many cards have powerful Ally abilities that reward you for using cards of the same faction together. As you acquire cards using Trade, you put them into your discard pile, to be later shuffled into your personal deck. When you play a Ship, you do what it says and then place it into your discard pile at the end of your turn. When you play a Base, you place it face up in front of you and may use its abilities once every turn. In addition to Combat being the way you reduce your opponent&rsquo;s Authority to zero and win the game, it&rsquo;s also useful for destroying your opponent&rsquo;s Bases. Some Bases are designated as Outposts. Your opponent&rsquo;s Outposts must be destroyed before you can use Combat to attack your opponent&rsquo;s Authority directly.\n\nStar Realms is easy to learn, especially if you&rsquo;re familiar with deck-building games, but takes time to master. Each time you play, the game is filled with various strategic decision points. Should I take the best card for me or the best card for my opponent? Should I focus on taking cards of a particular faction or on taking the best card available? Should I be focusing on acquiring more Trade or more Combat? Should I attack my opponent&rsquo;s Base or their Authority? These are just some of the many choices you&rsquo;ll be faced with. New players needn&rsquo;t agonize over these choices just to play, but as they become more advanced players, they will find this depth of strategy leads to great replayability.\n\nThe Star Realms set contains everything you need for two players. Including multiple copies (one copy for every two players) of the game and/or its standalone expansions, Star Realms: Colony Wars and Star Realms: Frontiers, allows up to six players to play a variety of multiplayer formats, including free-for-all and team play.\n\nThis is the first game of the Star Realms series.", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/EsJqPL5CB_TMt0MYL-lnVg__small/img/s_CE1b1XXUnYj9auTPhLrvkNsYA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1903816.jpg", "complexity": 1.9153, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 2, "playing_time": 20, "categories": ["Card Game", "Fighting", "Science Fiction"], "mechanics": ["Deck, Bag, and Pool Building", "Delayed Purchase", "Hand Management", "Income", "Multi-Use Cards", "Open Drafting", "Player Elimination", "Set Collection", "Tags", "Take That", "Variable Set-up"], "types": ["strategygames"], "bestwith": [2], "recommendedwith": [2], "pareto_rank": 5, "id": 147020}, {"name": "Too Many Bones: Undertow", "yearpublished": 2018, "bayesaverage": 7.40089, "average": 8.65717, "usersrated": 3855, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/235802", "description": "Join new playable Gearloc characters Stanza and Duster as they journey down the Sibron River in search of answers in this standalone expansion/sequel to Too Many Bones!\n\nToo Many Bones: Undertow allows for 1-2 players out of the box, but by bringing in additional Gearlocs from the original game or adding in characters like Ghillie, Nugget, and Tink, you can create an adventure for up to four players.

Each round, players send their heroes and allies to quest or to fight with enemies that engage them. However, as the heroes and allies exhaust after questing, defending, or attacking, the players' options are typically insufficient to deal with everything at once. Therefore, players need to determine whether it is more urgent to quest and make progress in the scenario while the enemy forces gain power, or to take down enemies while making no progress, not knowing what will come next.\n\nThe core set contains three scenarios, twelve famous heroes from the works of J.R.R. Tolkien (including Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Denethor, and &Eacute;owyn), and four pre-constructed player decks. Players can either use one of these decks or construct their own deck to increase their chances of success and to explore new strategies. Additionally, The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is a Living Card Game with over ten years of content, and much of its content has been re-released in the form of Campaign and Hero Expansions. Campaign Expansions contain new scenarios for players to embark upon, and Hero Expansions contain new heroes and new cards for players to use in their decks. (Older products include Deluxe Expansions, each containing two heroes, three quests and a medium-sized number of new player cards, and Adventure Packs, each containing one hero, one quest that continues the story started in a Deluxe Expansion and a small number of new player cards.)\n\nAlthough this game is set in Tolkien's Middle-earth, most scenarios in the game do not represent scenes from The Hobbit or The Lord of the Rings; rather, they are set in the seventeen years from Bilbo's 111th birthday until Frodo's departure from the Shire, allowing players to create their own stories and adventures in Middle-earth.

The success of your clan depends on your ability to make the right decision at the right time, be it by creating a new pasture for your livestock, growing barley for whisky production, selling your goods on the various markets, or gaining control of special landmarks such as lochs and castles.\n\nThe game lasts four rounds, represented by four stacks of tiles. After each round, a scoring phase takes place in which players compare their number of whisky casks, scotsmen in the home castle, landmark cards, and persons against the player with the fewest items in each category and receives victory points (VPs) based on the relative difference. After four rounds, additional VPs are awarded for gold coins and some landmarks while VP penalties are assessed based on territory size, comparing each player's territory to the smallest one in play.\n\nThe core mechanism of Glen More II: Chronicles and Glen More functions the same way: The last player in line takes a tile from a time track, advancing as far as they wish on this track. After paying the cost, they place this tile in their territory, with this tile activating itself and all neighboring tiles, triggering the production of resources, movement points, VPs, etc. Then the player who is last in line takes their turn.\n\nImprovements over the original Glen More include bigger tiles, better materials, new artwork, the ability for each player to control the end of the game, and balancing adjustments to the tiles for a better suspense curve. The game is designed to consist of one-third known systems, one-third new mechanisms, and one-third improvements to Glen More.\n\nThe \"Chronicles\" in the title &mdash; a set of eight expansions to the base game &mdash; are a major part of these new mechanisms. Each Chronicle adds a new gameplay element to the base game. The \"Highland Boat Race\" Chronicle, for example, tells the story of a boat race in which the winner needs to be the first to reach their home castle after navigating their boat along the river through all the other players' territories. The \"Hammer of the Scots\" Chronicle adds a neutral \"Englishman\" playing piece to the time track that players struggle to control to get an additional turn &mdash; if they can afford him, that is, as he is paid using the market mechanism. All Chronicles can be freely combined, although designer Matthias Cramer suggests that players use only one or two unless they want a \"monster game\".\n\nAnother major change to the game is the ability to invest in famous Scottish people of the time, who are represented through a new \"person\" tile type. Persons not only have their own scoring, they also trigger one-time or ongoing effects on the tactical clan board. This adds a new layer of decision making, especially since the ongoing effects allow players to focus on a personal strategy of winning through the use of the clan board.\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sMRuph3HFUcaSpJZihGZKw__small/img/UHuDcnjAwCiXbNfjuY26-EEnG2M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5841874.jpg", "complexity": 3.0031, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 4, "playing_time": 120, "categories": ["City Building", "Economic", "Farming", "Territory Building"], "mechanics": ["Commodity Speculation", "Grid Movement", "Market", "Set Collection", "Tile Placement", "Turn Order: Time Track"], "types": ["strategygames"], "bestwith": [3], "recommendedwith": [2, 3, 4], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 265188}, {"name": "Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective: The Thames Murders & Other Cases", "yearpublished": 1981, "bayesaverage": 7.37312, "average": 7.61068, "usersrated": 22492, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2511", "description": "Have you ever had the desire to walk the streets of Victorian London with Sherlock Holmes in search of Professor Moriarty?

During your struggle as the survivors, you will experience dramas connected with making extremely difficult decisions and choices and have to face the consequences of your actions sooner or later.\n\nTWOM: The Board Game features a multiplayer experience for up to 6 players, as well as a solo variant. You will be able to personify one of the well-known characters from video game and face hundreds of new challenges and difficult choices. The boardgame significantly broadens the original game&rsquo;s universe and emphasizes the depth of plot, yet its main focus will be on human interactions driven by survival instinct and group decision-making.  TWOM: The Board Game is an instant play game, with no need for reading the manual before starting the adventure.\n\nDuring day time you will take shelter in a ruined tenement house, which you will care about and manage by: removing rubble, searching through various rooms (often behind barricaded doors), you will build beds, improvised workshops, stoves, tools, water filters, small animal traps, you will cultivate an improvised vegetable garden, fix the tenements&rsquo; shelled facilities, reinforce the security of your shelter and should winter come, you&rsquo;ll try to keep it warm.\n\nUpon nightfall your main duties will consist of guarding your shelter and what little possessions you can accumulate against bandits and raiders. Those in your group fit for such a task will use the cover of the night to carefully explore dozens of the ever-changing locations scattered throughout the dangerous city in search of all the things that a person needs to survive (materials, food, meds, equipment, etc.). On your way you will meet tens of characters, each with a unique story (residents of the locations you visit, thieves, bandits, soldiers, war victims, refugees, neighbors, traders and members of local communities), each encounter is a potential, unique adventure. To guide you through all these events you will have the special SCRIPTS mechanism, responsible for implementing the deep and complex story and a coherent plot (each game will be unique and different than the previous).\n\nYour goal is to survive until the cessation of war hostilities.

But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle Earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.\n\nEach game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn. Depending on the face rolled on each die, different actions are possible (moving armies, characters, recruiting troops, advancing a Political Track).\n\nAction dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards. Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events that could possibly have happened) that cannot be portrayed through normal gameplay.

The game begins in the early eighteenth-century, when the Company has a weak foothold on the subcontinent. Over the course of the game, the Company might grow into the most powerful and insidious corporation in the world or collapse under the weight of its own ambition.\n\nJohn Company is a game about state-sponsored trade monopoly. Unlike most economic games players often do not control their own firms. Instead, they will collectively guide the Company by securing positions of power, attempting to steer the Company&rsquo;s fate in ways that benefit their own interests. However, the Company is an unwieldy thing. It is difficult to do anything alone, and players will often need to negotiate with one another. In John Company, most everything is up for negotiation.\n\nUltimately, this game isn&rsquo;t about wealth; it&rsquo;s about reputation. Each turn some of your family members may retire from their Company positions, giving them the opportunity to establish estates. Critically, players do not have full control over when these retirements happen. You will often need to borrow money from other players to make the best use for a chance of retirement. Players also gain victory points by competing in the London Season for prestige and securing fashionable properties.\n\nJohn Company engages very seriously with its theme. It is meant as a frank portrait of an institution that was as dysfunctional as it was influential. Accordingly, the game wrestles many of the key themes of imperialism and globalization in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and how those developments were felt domestically. As such, this game might not be suitable for all players.

Tsar Ivan wants to see results and our team will prove to him that we are the best builders in the city. We are sure to finish off those decorative arches with the brightest shining stones and ensure our place on the list of the government&rsquo;s trusted workers.\n\nSheila Santos and Israel Cendrero make up the game designing duo known as Llama Dice. To date they have put out various titles with different Spanish publishers (1987 Channel Tunnel, Mondrian, Smoothies), and The Red Cathedral is the first game they have published with Devir. Pedro Soto (Holmes, Sherlock & Mycroft, Papua) and Chema Rom&aacute;n (El mundo de &Aacute;guila Roja) took care of the graphic elements of the game with a grand homage to Ivan Bilibin, an iconic Russian artist from the turn of the twentieth century. Despite being from a far later period, his mark is very recognizable in the game.\n\nThe Red Cathedral is a strategic, &ldquo;Euro&rdquo; board game in which the players take the roles of construction teams. Their job is to work together to put up St. Basil's cathedral in Moscow, as ordered by Ivan the Terrible. However, only one of them will be able to gain the favor of the Tsar.\n\nDuring the game, the players can carry out one of these three actions: assign a section of the cathedral, send resources to that section to build it, or go to the game board to achieve more resources. Each of these actions has its own mechanism and requires that the players pay close attention to what the other players are doing.\n\nWhen the sections of the cathedral are assigned the players take possession of the spaces in each of the columns that make up their section. The more sections built and the completion of each with its own tower, the more points the player will be given at the end of the game.\n\nThe players can send resources to the cathedral sections that they have claimed. When they complete each of those sections they will obtain rewards in money and prestige points. They will also be able to install decorations on the completed sections to achieve even more recognition from the Tsar. This part of the game also works as a clock, since once any player completes the construction of their sixth section it brings about the end of the game.\n\nThe game board shows us the iconic rondel of The Red Cathedral. It is where the players obtain all the resource types needed to complete their work on the cathedral, as well as to get favors from the guilds and professionals to make the most of their trip to the market. In the central rondel the players choose the die they wish to use and move forward as many spaces as is shown on the top side of said die, in order to obtain the resources indicated in the space destined by the die.\n\nThe Red Cathedral is a very accessible game with regard to its rules because it is very easy to understand the various levels of the game, but it remains very interesting with regard to strategy. It is sure to please those who are more interested in the challenge offered by trying to strategically optimize their position in each game rather than the complexity of the rules.", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-PuiCnbxlBzMSjnUegp9AQ__small/img/CKamYUPlBDXav4A1AEqMRy976fY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5556025.jpg", "complexity": 2.8155, "min_players": 1, "max_players": 4, "playing_time": 80, "categories": ["Dice", "Economic"], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Contracts", "Dice Rolling", "End Game Bonuses", "Rondel", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Victory Points as a Resource"], "types": ["strategygames"], "bestwith": [3], "recommendedwith": [1, 2, 3, 4], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 227224}, {"name": "Modern Art", "yearpublished": 1992, "bayesaverage": 7.32742, "average": 7.52092, "usersrated": 24720, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/118", "description": "Buying and selling paintings can be a very lucrative business.

The 7-week war, fought along Japan's two major highways and in scattered sieges and backcountry skirmishes, elevated Tokugawa Ieyasu to Shogun and unified Japan for 265 years.\n\nSekigahara is designed to offer an historically authentic experience within an intuitive game mechanic that can be played in one sitting. Great effort has been taken to preserve a clean game mechanism. (Despite a healthy amount of historical detail, the ruleset is a brief 6 pages.) Chance takes the form of uncertainty and not luck.\n\nNo dice are used; combat is decided with cards. Blocks = armies and cards = motivation. The combination of army and motivation produces impact on the battlefield. Armies without matching cards don't fight. Battles resolve quickly, but with suspense, tactical participation, and a wide range of possible outcomes.\n\nLegitimacy is represented by hand size, which fluctuates each week according to the number of castles a player holds. Certain events deplete legitimacy, like force marches and lost battles. Recruitment, meanwhile, is a function of a daimyo's control over key production areas. Objectives (enemy units, castles, resources) exist all over the map.\n\nThe initial setup is variable, so the situation is always fresh. Concealed information (blocks and cards) lends additional uncertainty. In this way the game feels like the actual campaign.\n\nBlocks are large and stackable. Every unit on the board is visible at once, and the strategic situation is comprehensible at a glance. Components use authentic clan designations and colors, and have a Japanese feel.\n\nTrue to history, the objectives (castles and economic centers) and forces (armies of allied daimyo) are dispersed. Support for one front means neglect for another. The player is pulled between competing priorities. Each side wonders where his opponent wants to fight, and where he is unready. There is a great deal of bluff in the game.\n\nEach player must rally the several daimyo of his coalition, managing the morale and motivation of each clan. The forces are dispersed, and while there are reasons to unify them, the objectives are also dispersed, and the timeframe compact, so skirmishing will occur all over the island.\n\nTIME SCALE     1 week per 2-player turns\nMAP SCALE     Point to point\nUNIT SCALE     One block = 5000 soldiers\nNUMBER OF PLAYERS     2\n\nCOMPONENTS\n    Mounted Map\n    119 wooden pieces\n    1 and 1/2 sticker sheets\n    110 cards\n    Rulebook\n    Two player aid cards\n\nDESIGNER: Matthew Calkins\nMAP, CARD, & BLOCK ART: Mark Mahaffey\n\n(source: GMT website)", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eMJAona-uXwh6t2AcugGEg__small/img/6qn1NgnJ9inZNfLlrBdWK3FritU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1063508.jpg", "complexity": 2.802, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 2, "playing_time": 180, "categories": ["Civil War", "Pike and Shot", "Wargame"], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Card Play Conflict Resolution", "Force Commitment", "Hand Management", "Point to Point Movement", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Turn Order: Auction", "Variable Set-up"], "types": ["wargames"], "bestwith": [2], "recommendedwith": [2], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 25021}, {"name": "Cosmic Encounter", "yearpublished": 2008, "bayesaverage": 7.3185, "average": 7.50984, "usersrated": 34475, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/39463", "description": "Build a galactic empire...\n\nIn the depths of space, the alien races of the Cosmos vie with each other for control of the universe.

Based on the best-selling A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones is an epic board game in which it will take more than military might to win. Will you take power through force, use honeyed words to coerce your way onto the throne, or rally the townsfolk to your side? Through strategic planning, masterful diplomacy, and clever card play, spread your influence over Westeros!\n\nTo begin the game, each player receives an army of Footman, Knight, Siege Engine, and Ship units, as well as a set of Order tokens and other necessary components. Each player also receives a deck of unique House Cards, which are used as leaders in battles against rival Houses.\n\nEach round in the game is made up of three phases: the Westeros Phase, the Planning Phase, and the Action Phase. The Westeros Phase represents special events and day-to-day activities in Westeros. There are three different Westeros Decks, and each denotes a different global action, potentially affecting all players.\n\nThe Planning Phase is perhaps the most important. Here you secretly assign orders to all of your units by placing one order token face down on each area you control that contains at least one unit (Knight, Footman, Ship, or Siege Engine). This portion of the game emphasizes diplomacy and deduction. Can you trust the alliance that you made? Will you betray your ally and march upon him? Players may make promises to each other (for aid or peace, for example), but these promises are never binding. The result is tense and compelling negotiations, often ending in backstabbing worthy of Westeros!\n\nDuring the Action Phase, the orders are resolved and battle is entered! When armies meet in combat, they secretly choose one of their House cards to add strength to the battle. Finally, the Houses can consolidate their power in the areas they control and use that power in future turns to influence their position in the court of the Iron Throne and to stand against the wildling Hordes.\n\nIn addition to featuring updated graphics and a clarified ruleset, this second edition of A Game of Thrones includes elements from the A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords expansions, including ports, garrisons, Wildling cards, and Siege engines, while introducing welcome new innovations like player screens and Tides of Battle cards.\n\nTides of Battle cards are an optional mechanism that brings an element of unpredictability to combat, representing erratic shifts in the momentum of war due to factors such as weather, morale, and tactical opportunity. During each combat, both players draw one Tides of Battle card from a communal deck, and its value modifies the strength of his chosen House card. What's more, such a card may also contain icons that can affect the outcome of the battle...all of which delivers a new level of intensity to your military engagements.\n\nExpanded by:\n\n     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) \u2013 A Dance with Dragons (2012)\n     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) \u2013 A Feast for Crows (2013)\n     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) \u2013 Mother of Dragons (2018)\n\n\nReimplements:\n\n     A Game of Thrones (2003)\n     A Game of Thrones: A Clash of Kings Expansion (2004)\n     A Game of Thrones: A Storm of Swords Expansion (2006)", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/M_7UvwZvuxBVjxdadsa5AA__small/img/ZQ9guRvmMgYfseBC3_xNscMOKKo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1077906.jpg", "complexity": 3.7374, "min_players": 3, "max_players": 6, "playing_time": 240, "categories": ["Bluffing", "Fantasy", "Negotiation", "Novel-based", "Political", "Wargame"], "mechanics": ["Advantage Token", "Alliances", "Area Movement", "Auction / Bidding", "Auction: Sealed Bid", "Card Play Conflict Resolution", "Events", "Hand Management", "Income", "Negotiation", "Order Counters", "Player Elimination", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Sudden Death Ending", "Turn Order: Auction", "Variable Player Powers"], "types": ["strategygames"], "bestwith": [6], "recommendedwith": [4, 5, 6], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 103343}, {"name": "Azul: Summer Pavilion", "yearpublished": 2019, "bayesaverage": 7.3044, "average": 7.57591, "usersrated": 18675, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/287954", "description": "At the turn of the 16th Century, King Manuel I commissioned Portugal's greatest artisans to construct grandiose buildings. After completing the Palaces of Evora and Sintra, the king sought to build a summer pavilion to honor the most famous members of the royal family. This construction was intended for the most talented artisans &mdash; whose skills meet the splendor that the royal family deserves. Sadly, King Manuel I died before construction ever began.\n\nIn Azul: Summer Pavilion, players return to Portugal to accomplish the task that never began. As a master artisan, you must use the finest materials to create the summer pavilion while carefully avoiding wasting supplies. Only the best will rise to the challenge to honor the Portuguese royal family.\n\nAzul: Summer Pavilion lasts six rounds, and in each round players draft tiles, then place them on their individual player board to score points. Each of the six colors of tiles is wild during one of the rounds.\n\nAt the start of each round, draw tiles at random from the bag to refill each of the five, seven, or nine factories with four tiles each. Draw tiles as needed to refill the ten supply spaces on the central scoring board. Players then take turns drafting tiles. You can choose to take all of the tiles of a non-wild color on a factory and place them next to your board; if any wild tiles are on this factory, you must take one of them. Place all remaining tiles in the center of the table. Alternatively, you can take all tiles of a non-wild color from the center of play; you must also take one wild tile, if present.\n\nAfter all tiles have been claimed, players then take turns placing tiles on their individual boards. Each board depicts seven stars that would be composed of six tiles; each space on a star shows a number from 1-6, and six of the stars are for tiles of a single color while the seventh will be composed of one tile of each color. To place a tile on the blue 5, for example, you must discard five blue or wild tiles from next to your player board (with at least one blue being required), placing one blue tile in the blue 5 space and the rest in the discard tower. You score 1 point for this tile and 1 point for each tile within this star connected to the newly placed tile.\n\nIf you completely surround a pillar, statue, or window on your game board with tiles, you get an immediate bonus, taking 1-3 tiles from the central supply spaces and placing them next to your board.

From there, build your budding railroad network into a vast empire. Connect New York to Chicago, earn the most money, develop bigger and faster locomotives and maybe even span North America and build the Transcontinental Railway!\n\nMultiple expansions featuring different maps are available.

Railroad Tycoon was the result of a collaboration with Glenn Drover, in which the mechanics and game-play of Martin Wallace's Age of Steam were simplified and streamlined and attractive over-produced components were added, in order to make Railroad Tycoon more appealing to less hardcore gamers and more accessible to a wider audience.\n\nA revised reprint was published at the end of 2010 which made some component improvements, such as the addition of Railroad Operation cards for the Mexico map.\n\nComplete series overview - The Railways of the World Series: Introducing the family members of the ideal medium-weight train game\n\nNote: The RailRoad Tycoon board itself is gigantic (about 36x45 inches, 91x114 cm) and requires a huge table or playing on the floor.\n\nSimilar to:\n\n     Steam", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Sz0wLg3TgycpzSvSMdzRJA__small/img/lfoHFV0OafSO8boxKEX8V3Tq5TM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3869603.jpg", "complexity": 3.0143, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 6, "playing_time": 120, "categories": ["Trains", "Transportation", "Video Game Theme"], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Connections", "End Game Bonuses", "Hexagon Grid", "Income", "Loans", "Network and Route Building", "Open Drafting", "Ownership", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Tile Placement", "Turn Order: Auction"], "types": ["strategygames"], "bestwith": [5], "recommendedwith": [3, 4, 5, 6], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 17133}, {"name": "Clash of Cultures: Monumental Edition", "yearpublished": 2021, "bayesaverage": 7.30358, "average": 8.26878, "usersrated": 4812, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/299659", "description": "Clash of Cultures: Monumental Edition brings back the classic game of exploration, expansion, and development with the Clash of Cultures base game and the Civilizations and Aztecs expansions in one box!

New buildings enter the game from time to time, and players can construct them on their game boards with the building materials they gather, with some terrain restrictions on what can be built where.

Quite an ambitious undertaking for one game, yet Commands & Colors, by design, is a unique historical wargame system which allows players to effectively portray stylized battles from this time in history. The 15 battles showcased in the scenario booklet, although stylized, focus on important terrain features and the historical deployment of forces in scale with the game system. The battles include Bagradas, Cannae, and Zama.\n\n\"The scale of the game fluctuates from battle to battle. For some scenarios, an infantry unit may represent a legion of fighters, while in other scenarios a unit may represent just a few brave warriors. But the tactics you need to execute conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to the various units, their weapons, terrain and time.\n\n\"Unlike its older brother, Battle Cry by Avalon Hill, Commands & Colors: Ancients is moderately more complex and contains additional historical details without the battlefield clutter. Most scenarios will still play to a conclusion in less than an hour.\n\n\"The command card system, drives movement, creates a true fog of war and presents both challenges and opportunities. There are four types of command cards: Leadership cards, Section cards, Troop cards and Tactic cards.\n\n\"The battle dice system resolves all combat efficiently and quickly.

Each card has four possible uses: operational movement, strategic movement, special events, and replacement points.

Great nations protect and provide for their own, while fighting and competing against both other nations and nature itself. Nations must provide food and stability as the population increases. They must build a productive economy. And all the while, they must amaze the world with their great achievements to build up their heritage as the greatest nations in the history of mankind!\n\nNations is an intense historical board game for 1&ndash;5 players that takes 40 minutes per player to play. Players control the fate of nations from their humble start in prehistoric times until the beginning of World War I. The nations constantly compete against each other and must balance immediate needs, long-term growth, threats, and opportunities.\n\nGameplay introduction\n\nPlayers choose a Nation and a difficulty to play at, similar to the Civilization computer games series. After the growth phase, 2 historical events are revealed, which the players will compete for during the round. Then players take a single small action each, in player order, as many times as they wish until all have passed. Actions are:\n\n\n     Buy a card\n     Deploy a worker\n     Hire an architect for a wonder\n     Special action provided by a card\n\n\nPlayers each have individual boards that represent their Nation. There are many ways that players affect, compete, and indirectly interact with other players. But there is no map, no units to move around, and no direct attacks on other players.\n\nWhen all have passed, there is production, new player order is determined (every position is competed for), the historical events happen, and if this is the last round of an age, the books are scored. At the start of a new round, most old cards are removed and new ones are put on the display.\n\nVictory points are gained and lost during the game, and also awarded at the end of the game.

To set up the game, players choose a mastermind villain (Magneto, Loki, Dr. Doom, Red Skull in the base game), stack that particular villain's attack cards underneath it, then modify the villain deck as needed based on that villain's particular scheme. Players then choose a number of hero decks &ndash; Spider-Man, Hulk, Wolverine, etc. &ndash; and shuffle them together; since players use only a handful of hero decks out of the fifteen included, the hero deck can vary widely in terms of what's available.\n\nOver the course of the game, players will recruit powerful hero cards to add to their deck in order to build a stronger and more resourceful deck. Players need to build both their recruitment powers (to enlist more heroes) and their fighting ability (to combat the villains who keep popping up to cause trouble). Players recruit heroes from an array of five cards, with empty slots refilled as needed. At the start of a player's turn, he reveals a villain and adds it to the row of villains. This row has a limited number of spaces, and if it fills up, the earliest villain to arrive escapes, possibly punishing the heroes in some way. Some villains also take an action when showing up for the first time, such as kidnapping an innocent bystander. The villain deck also contains \"master strike\" cards, and whenever one of these shows up, the mastermind villain (controlled by the game) takes a bonus action.\n\nAs players fight and defeat villains, they collect those cards, which will be worth points at game's end. Players can also fight the mastermind; if a player has enough fighting power, he claims one of the attack cards beneath the mastermind, which has a particular effect on the game. If all of these cards are claimed, the game ends and players tally their points to see who wins. If the mastermind completes his scheme, however &ndash; having a certain number of villains escape, for example, or imposing a certain number of wounds on the heroes &ndash; then the players all lose.\n\nHero decks in the base game: Gambit, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Emma Frost, Thor, Spider-Man, Iron Man, Storm, Captain America, Nick Fury, Rogue, Cyclops, Hulk, Wolverine, Deadpool", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZrRidumkzu62HuwKdgQpHA__small/img/Q9zldSDfcsSXiD6SC4MU-dwCl5g=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1430769.jpg", "complexity": 2.4341, "min_players": 1, "max_players": 5, "playing_time": 60, "categories": ["Card Game", "Comic Book / Strip"], "mechanics": ["Deck, Bag, and Pool Building", "Events", "Open Drafting", "Semi-Cooperative Game", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Variable Set-up"], "types": ["thematic"], "bestwith": [3], "recommendedwith": [1, 2, 3, 4], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 129437}, {"name": "Ticket to Ride: Europe \u2013 15th Anniversary", "yearpublished": 2021, "bayesaverage": 7.2281, "average": 8.1886, "usersrated": 4571, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/329841", "description": "Ticket to Ride: Europe &ndash; 15th Anniversary contains material from the Ticket to Ride: Europe base game and only the tickets from Europa 1912 expansion for a total of 108 destination ticket cards.\n\nIn Ticket to Ride: Europe, you collect cards of various types of train cars that you then use to claim railway routes in Europe.

Competing companies deal in spices, send ships and colonists into the world, and invest money. Are you on top or at the bottom? It depends on how you invest your profits. Will you make your ships more efficient? Enhance your plantations? Recruit more colonists? Only a steady hand in business will help.\n\nEach turn begins with an auction phase, where each player gets to auction one item (and the starting player two items). The first item being auctioned gives the right to go first the next turn (along with a card that gives an extra action). If you buy your own item, you pay it to the bank. If someone else buys the item you sell, they pay you. Items include plantations complete with crops, income tiles (income in money, ships, plantation refills each turn etc.), ships, settlers, and later on tiles that score points for certain achievements.\n\nAfter the auction, players get three actions to either improve their technologies or produce things such as spices on plantations, ships, money or build more plantations. Each player has a board showing their advancement for various things: getting ships, planting new spices, getting colonists, etc. The more a player advances along one track, the better one is doing that particular action. The further you get along a certain track, the more points that track is worth at the end, and there are also rewards to the first player who reaches the last two levels along each track. On the other hand, each player normally needs to perform the actions for all the tracks at some point, so it's not necessarily a good idea to concentrate on just a couple of them. Goa is a game that gives plenty of opportunity for tough decisions, since a player always has at least one action too few.\n\nThe game mixes an interactive element of the auction, which encourages you to nominate things that other players want so you receive cash with the solitaire management of your plantation, which then interacts later on as players race to be first in the top tech levels.\n\nThe 2012 edition of Goa includes four new tiles and a new play variant, as noted on the cover of the Z-Man Games edition.", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qVr5oSdmchY0XauUmh5DrQ__small/img/CX75cO_XT7AJG5AheWvAvop_IGY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic9209550.jpg", "complexity": 3.3659, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 4, "playing_time": 90, "categories": ["Economic", "Farming", "Nautical", "Renaissance"], "mechanics": ["Auction / Bidding", "Auction: Once Around", "Hand Management", "Push Your Luck", "Tech Trees / Tech Tracks"], "types": ["strategygames"], "bestwith": [4], "recommendedwith": [2, 3, 4], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 9216}, {"name": "Skull King", "yearpublished": 2013, "bayesaverage": 7.19836, "average": 7.53177, "usersrated": 14130, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/150145", "description": "Skull King is a trick-taking game similar to Oh Hell!, Wizard, Euchre and Spades, with players needing to state how many tricks they think they'll win each round. A unique element of this game is that bidding takes place simultaneously, leading to rounds that are sometimes over, or under-bid. As players must win the exact number of tricks that they bid to earn points, winning too many tricks is just as bad as winning too few and this leads to intense competition where losing a trick can be as exciting as winning one.\n\nSkull King uses a 66-card deck that consists of five Escape cards, four suits numbered 1-13, two Mermaids, five Pirate cards, 1 Tigress card, and 1 Skull King card. The game lasts ten rounds, and in each round, each player is dealt as many cards as the number of the round. All players simultaneously bid on the number of tricks they think they'll take by holding out a fist and on the count of three revealing a certain number of fingers (or possibly a closed fist for a bid of zero tricks).\n\nStandard rules apply for the playing of cards, with one player leading off a card and other players following suit, if possible, and playing something else if not; however, a player may always choose to play one of the special, unnumbered cards &mdash; and the power of those cards might let you win a trick that otherwise would have gotten away. In more detail, the black Jolly Roger suit trumps the other three suits, a Mermaid trumps all numbered cards, a Pirate trumps the Mermaid, and the Skull King trumps everything &mdash; except if he appears in the same trick with a Mermaid, in which case she captures him and wins instead. An Escape card loses to any other card, and the Tigress card serves as either a pirate or escape card as desired by the player. Whoever wins a trick leads in the next trick.\n\nIf a player makes their bid exactly, they score 20 points per trick; if they collect more or fewer tricks, they lose 10 points per trick they are off. If a player makes a bid of zero tricks, they win points equal to ten times the current round number &mdash; but if they take even a single trick, they lose this many points instead. If a player catches pirates with the Skull King, or the King with a mermaid, they score bonus points.

Corporation Incorporated builds them. Everyone knows their drivers -- the brave men and women who fear no danger and would, if the pay was good enough, even fly through Hell.\n Now you can join them. You will gain access to prefabricated spaceship components cleverly made from sewer pipes. Can you build a space ship durable enough to weather storms of meteors? Armed enough to defend against pirates? Big enough to carry a large crew and valuable cargo? Fast enough to get there first?\n\nOf course you can. Become a Galaxy Trucker. It's loads of fun.\n\nGalaxy Trucker is a tile laying game that plays out over two phases: building and flying. The goal is to have the most credits at the end of the game. You can earn credits by delivering goods, defeating pirates, building an efficient ship, and being the furthest along the track at the end of the flying phase.\n\nBuilding happens in real time and has players build their personal space ships by grabbing tiles from the middle of the table before the timer runs out. Tiles start out facedown so they won't know what they have until they take it, but they may choose to return it faceup if they don't want it. They must place the tiles they keep in a legal manner in their space ship. Usually this just means lining up the connectors appropriately (single to single, double to double, universal to anything) but also includes proper positioning of guns and engines. Tiles represent a variety of things including guns, engines, storage containers, crew cabins, shields, and batteries. They may also peek at the cards they will encounter in phase 2, but they must sacrifice building time to do this. At any time players may call their ships finished and take an order marker from the center.\n\nOnce building is completed, and ships have been checked for errors, the flight begins. The flight cards are shuffled and player markers are placed on the flight board according to the order markers taken. Cards are revealed one at a time and players interact with them in order. They may include things such as pirates, abandoned vessels, disease outbreaks, meteor showers, worlds with goods to pick up, combat zones, and other various things.\n\nMost of the cards will cause players to move back on the flight track and they must decide if the delay is worth their efforts. When all the cards are encountered players sell any goods they have collected, collect their rewards for finishing in first, second, or third place or having the most intact ship, and then lose some credits for damaged components. Space can be a very dangerous place and it is not uncommon to see your ship break into smaller and smaller pieces or lose some very valuable cargo off the side. If your ship gets damaged too much you can get knocked out of the race, so be careful!\n\n3 rounds of this are done, and in each round players get a bigger board to build a ship that can hold more components.

The Election of 1960 is the story of two men, John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon. One is the scion of a wealthy, politically powerful family from New England. The other is the son of a Quaker grocer in Whittier, California. While they belong to opposing political parties, they start out as friends. The complex development of that friendship, however, would shape a pivotal presidential election and cast a long shadow over American history for the remainder of the 20th century.\n\n\"In 1960: The Making of the President, you take on the role of one of these great protagonists vying for the right to lead his country into the heart of the Cold War. However, it is not just foreign policy that poses a challenge to American leadership; this is also an era of great social turmoil and progress. As the United States continues to build upon the promise of its founding, candidates must contend with the question of civil rights and balance their positions on social justice against the need for valuable Southern electoral votes. Of course, the ever-present issue of the economy also rears its ugly head, and both Nixon and Kennedy will compete to be the candidate with the voters' pocket books in mind.\n\n\"The contest is fought out on an electoral map of the United States as it stood in 1960&mdash;a map where Louisiana and Florida share the same number of electoral votes, as do California and Pennsylvania. Using a card-driven game system, all the major events which shaped the campaign are represented: Nixon&rsquo;s lazy shave, President Eisenhower&rsquo;s late endorsement, and the 'Catholic question' are all included as specific event cards. The famous televised debates and final election day push are each handled with their own subsystems. Candidates vie to capture each state&rsquo;s electoral votes using campaign points in the four different regions of the country. At the same time, they must build momentum by dominating the issues of the day and attempt to gain control of the airwaves.\n\n\"As with any election campaign, the challenge is to adapt your game plan as the ground shifts out from under you. There are never enough resources or time to do everything, but you need to make the tough calls to propel yourself into the White House. This fast-playing strategy game for two players challenges you to run for the most powerful elective office in the world, at one of its most unique crossroads. Will you recreate history, or rewrite it? 1960: The Making of the President provides you the opportunity to do both.\"", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/p-k_CqUvJzTcMMz4ms7f_Q__small/img/LZFIiC173jPXvtxUGeNh9eGedpc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3499166.jpg", "complexity": 3.2045, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 2, "playing_time": 120, "categories": ["Political", "Wargame"], "mechanics": ["Action / Event", "Area Majority / Influence", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Hand Management", "Simulation"], "types": ["strategygames"], "bestwith": [2], "recommendedwith": [2], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 27708}, {"name": "Bora Bora", "yearpublished": 2013, "bayesaverage": 7.17706, "average": 7.55881, "usersrated": 10622, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/127060", "description": "Stake your fortunes in the mysterious island world of Bora Bora.

The heart of the game is its action resolution system in which 5-7 actions are available each round, the exact number depending on the number of players. Each player rolls three dice at the start of the round, then they take turns placing one die at a time on one action. Place a high number on an action, and you'll generally get a better version of that action: more places to build, more choices of people to take, better positioning on the temple track, and so on.

Equip your ancestral magical items, summon your most faithful familiars to your side and be ready to face the challenge!\n\nSeasons is a tactical game of cards and dice which takes place in two phases:\n\nThe first phase \"Prelude\" consists of a card draft: the goal during this phase will be to establish your own 9-card deck for the main part of the game and with it the strategy.\n\nOnce the Prelude is complete, each player must separate their 9 cards into 3 packs of 3 cards. They will begin the second phase of the game with their first pack of three cards, then gradually as the game progresses, they will receive the other two packets of three cards.\n\nNext comes the Tournament: at the beginning of each round a player will roll the seasons dice (dice = number of players +1).\n\nThese cubes offer a variety of actions to the players: \n- Increase your gauge (maximum number of cards you may have placed on the table and in play) \n- Harvesting energy (water, earth, fire, air) to pay the cost of power cards\n- Crystallizing the energy (during the current season) to collect crystals. Crystals serve both as a resource to pay for some cards, but also as victory points in the end. \n- Draw new cards\n\nEach player can choose only one die per turn. The die not chosen by anyone determines how many fields the \"time track\" would move forward.\nIn addition, all the dice are different depending on the season. For example, there are not the same energies to a particular season. Throughout the game, players will therefore have to adapt to these changes - also the \"exchange rates\" of energy to crystals vary during seasons - the energy not present on the dice in any given season is also the best paid during the season.\n\nAt the end of the game, the crystals are summed with victory points granted by the cards (minus some penalties, where applicable).

As temporal agents, you and your team will be sent into the bodies of beings from different worlds or realities to successfully complete the missions given to you. Failure is impossible, as you will be able to go back in time as many times as required.\n\nT.I.M.E Stories is a narrative game, a game of \"decksploration\". Each player is free to give their character as deep a \"role\" as they want, in order to live through a story, as much in the game as around the table. But it's also a board game with rules which allow for reflection and optimization.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the players are at their home base and receive their mission briefing. The object is then to complete it in as few attempts as possible. The actions and movements of the players will use Temporal Units (TU), the quantity of which depend on the scenario and the number of players. Each attempt is called a \"run\"; one run equals the use of all of the Temporal Units at the players' disposal. When the TU reach zero, the agents are recalled to the agency, and restart the scenario from the beginning, armed with their experience. The object of the game is to make the perfect run, while solving all of the puzzles and overcoming all of a scenario&rsquo;s obstacles.\n\nYou usually take possession of local hosts to navigate in a given environment, but who knows what you'll have to do to succeed? Roam a med-fan city, looking for the dungeon where the Syaan king is hiding? Survive in the Antarctic while enormous creatures lurk beneath the surface of the ice? Solve a puzzle in an early 20th century asylum? That is all possible, and you might even have to jump from one host to another, or play against your fellow agents from time to time.\n\nThe base box contains the entirety of the T.I.M.E Stories system and allows players to play all of the scenarios, the first of which &mdash; Asylum &mdash; is included. During a scenario, which consists of a deck of 120+ cards, each player explores cards, presented most often in the form of a panorama. Access to some cards require the possession of the proper item or items, while others present surprises, enemies, riddles, clues, and other dangers. An insert allows players to \"save\" the game at any point, to play over multiple sessions, just like in a video game. This way, it's possible to pause your ongoing game by preserving the state of the receptacles, the remaining TU, the discovered clues, etc.\n\n--description from the publisher", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XmwCsjQ3C1Ul53ZN2o8Q-Q__small/img/tTU1YVtab-cN5gCdagINowvVA2g=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2617634.png", "complexity": 2.5882, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 4, "playing_time": 90, "categories": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Science Fiction"], "mechanics": ["Cooperative Game", "Dice Rolling", "Move Through Deck", "Narrative Choice / Paragraph", "Storytelling", "Variable Player Powers"], "types": ["thematic"], "bestwith": [4], "recommendedwith": [2, 3, 4], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 146508}, {"name": "CATAN: Cities & Knights", "yearpublished": 1998, "bayesaverage": 7.1511, "average": 7.44873, "usersrated": 21308, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/926", "description": "Adds several new aspects to Settlers of Catan but the two major ones are creating knights to protect the land from invading barbarians and building city improvements that confer benefits upon that city's owner. Adds tactical complexity to the game and game length.\n\nBelongs to the Catan Series.\n\nThe game changes the base game in three main ways:\n\nFirst, there are 3 new commodities in the game, distinct from resources - paper, cloth, and coins, which can be acquired from Forest, Meadow, and Mountain spaces, respectively. Cities that would normally produce two of one of those resources instead produce 1 resource and 1 of the corresponding commodity. (To make commodities easier to obtain, each player starts the game with 1 city and 1 settlement on the board.) These commodities allow players to build city improvements that confer various advantages and eventually points.\n\nSecond, the deck of development cards is replaced by three different decks, each corresponding to one of the commodities. Building city improvements gives players a chance to draw these cards with every roll of the dice. Building more improvements will increase these chances, but cards cannot be bought directly in any way. These cards are similar to the development cards in the base game, but with a wider range of effects. (Some cards are balanced better as well - the new Resource Monopoly card, for example, can take no more than 2 of the named resource from any one player.)\n\nFinally, players can also build knights on the island along their network of roads. These knights can be used to claim certain intersections and move the Robber (taking the place of Soldier cards), but are also used to defend the island from periodic barbarian attacks. If the island is successfully defended, the player(s) with the most knights are rewarded.

The game originally consisted of a single deck of cards of rank 2&ndash;10 in five different colors with three special \"handshakes\" (\"HS\" in scoring examples below) in each suit, but as of 2018 the game now includes six colored suits, with the sixth color being optional for gameplay. A game board is included to organize discarded cards and help players organize their card collections.\n\nThe object of the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the colored suits of cards. On a player's turn, they must first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the color-appropriate discard pile, then draw one card, either from the deck or from the top of a discard pile. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order, but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.\n\nThe game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the deck. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total; one handshake doubles an expedition's value, while two handshakes triples that value and three handshakes quadruple it. Expeditions start at a value of -20, so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least eight cards played into it. A complete game of Lost Cities lasts three matches, with scores for each match being added together.\n\nScoring example 1: An expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 plus the initial -20.\n\nScoring example 2: An expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40. This expedition is worth 80 total points: 40 points for cards, plus the initial -20, &times;3 for the two multipliers, plus the 20-pt bonus for playing 8+ cards.\n\nScoring example 3: An expedition has 1 HS, and 4,6,7 for a total of 17.

Players acquire production companies, which produce goods (rice, spices, microwaveable meals, rubber, and oil), and shipping companies, which deliver goods to cities.

Production companies earn money for each good delivered to a city, up to the city's capacity, but they must pay shipping companies for the distance traveled, even if they end up losing money. Players can research advantages, like greater shipping capacity or the ability to merge companies, possibly stealing ownership of lucrative plantations or shipping routes by buying out other players.\n\nPlayers keep their money hidden, trying to accumulate the most by the end of the third era. When only one type of a company is left, an era ends. New eras bring new cities, companies, and types of goods. At the end of the third era, the player with the most money wins.

It has been inspired by the old kingdoms surrounding the Great Zimbabwe, a world heritage site in southern Africa. Far into the previous century, colonial governments denied that a civilization that produced such impressive monuments and beautiful artwork could have been African in origin. But of course, this civilization was African, and the country of Zimbabwe itself was proudly named after this impressive cultural heritage. As always in our games, we have used this history for inspiration; however, first and foremost we wanted to create a highly playable and replayable Splotter game, so in many cases we took liberties with historical names, periods and artwork.\n\nIn the game, players strive to build the most impressive monuments to one god of their choice. They can choose this god themselves-- each of the twelve gods offers a unique blessing, but each also requires a different amount of work to win the game. Building the monuments is done by developing a logistics network stretching across the region. Through this network, players produce and obtain ritual goods to raise their monuments and bring honour to the god of their choice.\n\nHere's the flavour text from the rules:\n\nThe Mutapa king struts into the village, followed by a bunch of young warriors herding cattle. &ldquo;Oondabezitha &rdquo;, he addresses the assembly of kings, &ldquo;I have brought twelve heads of cattle for the ceremony tonight&rdquo;. The others seem to shrink in stature as he speaks. The star of the king of Mutapa is clearly ascending. They have not brought nearly as much cattle themselves. &ldquo;Soon, we will all be praying to Obatala&rdquo;, murmurs one of the older Kilwa traders. &ldquo;The Mutapa will be raising their godless monuments sky-high. Perhaps it is time for us to resort to some magic of our own&rdquo;. Then the sky breaks into a thunder and a torrential rain pours down on the assembly. The men scramble while the plains fill with water. The ceremony will be wet tonight...\n\n\nThe Great Zimbabwe is a logistico-economic game in which players are tribal leaders in Africa trying to please the gods by building monuments.\n\nBuying technology, building craftsmen, gathering resources and worshipping a god are among the many decisions necessary to win in 'The Great Zimbabwe'. But the main way of getting there is building and developing a network of monuments. The higher the monuments, the closer the players will be to victory, but players must balance many subtle aspects of the game. If they develop their economy, if they worship a powerful god or if they use a lot of technology, they will need to score more victory points.\n\nClever use of turn-order manipulation, economic development in an almost close environment, scarce natural resource use and logistical optimization to deliver goods from craftsmen to monuments: You only get one action per turn, so be smart! 'The Great Zimbabwe' is a race for victory, in which you decide how far you want to go and at what speed. Then other players' decisions change everything...", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KoL5aL8f_OpyzB9yYSI8VA__small/img/tGLIa6i13UQJv2-Xj47XEHZrDRg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1400856.jpg", "complexity": 3.6848, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 5, "playing_time": 150, "categories": ["Civilization", "Economic", "Industry / Manufacturing", "Transportation"], "mechanics": ["Auction / Bidding", "Income", "Market", "Modular Board", "Network and Route Building", "Open Drafting", "Ownership", "Square Grid", "Tile Placement", "Turn Order: Auction", "Variable Player Powers", "Variable Set-up"], "types": ["strategygames"], "bestwith": [4], "recommendedwith": [2, 3, 4, 5], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 111341}, {"name": "The Manhattan Project: Energy Empire", "yearpublished": 2016, "bayesaverage": 7.13434, "average": 7.72757, "usersrated": 6514, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/176734", "description": "From the ashes of war, nations rise to power in the atomic age.

The 1966 version of the 3M bookshelf edition included rules for a 2-player variant. The original version is part of the 3M Bookshelf Series.\n\nMany books and websites incorrectly list this as a 1962 publication as the 3M Company used previously copyrighted artwork when they released the game in 1964. 3M actually received the idea for the game of \"Vacations\" from Sid Sackson in May of 1963 and decided to take his idea and put it into artwork they had developed the year before for a game called \"ACQUIRE.\" 3M's original game idea for a game called ACQUIRE must not have been very good so they decided to take Sid's idea of Vacations and put it into their concept of ACQUIRE. They released some limited test market games in 8 Midwestern U.S. cities in December of 1963 with a box that had a 1963 copyright. These games had Sid's original rules. When 3M released the mass market games in 1964, they had developed some of Sid's original ideas and changed some rules and game play to match their production desires. They released them with outer boxes that were copyrighted 1962 and inner boxes with rules that were dated 1963.\n\nDecember 1963 - Test Market World Map Wood Tile Edition\n1964 - Dated 1962/63 wood tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay & stocks with printed backs\n1965 - Dated 1962/63 plastic tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay & stocks with printed backs (last edition made with printed backs until 1999)\n1966 - Dated 1962/66 plastic tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay & non-wax coated stocks (Only edition with these stocks)\n1968 - Dated 1968/66 plastic tiles, clear plastic board with paper underlay (Both 1966 inner box games have a lot of mixed parts)\n1971 - Dated 1968/71 plastic tiles, yellow hard plastic board\n1975 - 3M sells rights for game of ACQUIRE to the Avalon Hill Company\n1976 - Dated 1976 plastic tiles, yellow hard plastic board, redesigned money, no inner box (This edition was also produced in 1977, 79, 81, 82,       & 86)\n1989 - Dated 1976 Gray box edition with new box artwork same contents as regular 1976 editions (This edition was also produced in 1992)\n1995 - Dated 1995 Large box cardboard edition with chipboard board and tiles, Special Powers Variant Tiles inspired by German editions\n1997 - Avalon Hill sells the rights to the game of ACQUIRE to Hasbro\n1999 - Dated 1999 Large box with large plastic board and tiles, 3D company buildings, redesigned stocks & money, large info cards\n2006 - Hasbro assigns rights for the game of ACQUIRE to their subsidiary, Wizards of the Coast\n2006 - Lloyd's (private) Rules of ACQUIRE are made public, two major rule changes that help to bring the balance of the game of ACQUIRE back to the  intentions of Sid Sackson's original ideas.

Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any meeples you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande (large meeple) and in the region containing the king.\n\nEl Grande Big Box, the 20th anniversary edition of El Grande, includes all previously published expansions: Grand Inquisitor & Colonies, Grandissimo, King & Intrigant, King & Intrigant: Players' Edition and King & Intrigant: Special Cards as well as something currently known only as the \"Anniversary Extension\".", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dTREkApZZA0e46TYFmVgIA__small/img/abTJAmQCzAMIrwzBcXtd4gPMQmY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2748424.jpg", "complexity": 2.8, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 5, "playing_time": 90, "categories": ["Renaissance"], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Area Movement", "Auction / Bidding", "Hand Management", "Memory", "Open Drafting", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "types": ["strategygames"], "bestwith": [5], "recommendedwith": [3, 4, 5], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 171908}, {"name": "Space Alert", "yearpublished": 2008, "bayesaverage": 7.1168, "average": 7.38123, "usersrated": 16454, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/38453", "description": "Space Alert is a cooperative team survival game.

Over the course of the game, each race must trade and negotiate with the rest to acquire the resource cubes necessary to fund their economy and allow it to produce goods for the next turn. Scheming, dealing, and mutually beneficial agreements are key to success. While technically a competitive game, Sidereal Confluence has a cooperative feel during the trading phase as no race has the ability to thrive on its own. Trade well, and you'll develop technologies and colonize planets to form a civilization that is the envy of the galaxy.\n\nEach player chooses one of the nine unique and asymmetrical alien races that have come together to form a trade federation in their quadrant. Each race has its own deck of cards representing all the existing and future technologies it might research. Some races also have other cards related to unique features of their culture. These cards represent portions of the culture's economy and require spending some number of cubes to use, resulting in an output of more cubes, ships, and possibly victory points. Since each culture's outputs rarely match their inputs, players need to trade goods with one another to run their converters to create the resources they truly need to run their society most efficiently and have an effective economy. Almost everything is negotiable, including colonies, ships, and all kinds of resources.\n\nEach game round contains an open trading phase in which all players can negotiate and execute deals for cubes, ships, colonies, even the temporary use of technologies! Players with enough resources can also research technologies, upgrade colonies, and spend resources on their race's special cards during this phase. Once complete, all players simultaneously run their economies, spending resources to gain more resources. The Confluence follows, starting with players sharing newly researched technologies with all other races and following with bidding to acquire new colonies and research teams. Researching a new technology grants many victory points for the prestige of helping galactic society advance. When one race builds a new technology, it is shared with everyone else. Technologies can be upgraded when combined with other technologies.\n\nThe ultimate goal is victory points, which are acquired by researching technologies, using your economy to convert resources to goods, and converting your leftover goods into points at the end of the game.\n\nThe game is almost all simultaneous play.\n\nSidereal Confluence: Remastered Edition features the same gameplay as the first edition of the game from 2017, but features an updated card layout, a teaching guide, and an improved rulebook for easy set-up and learning with more visual examples and clear key terms.", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3V1Nmee3P4qSpVmWO9uGgw__small/img/ptUAPVk_LoqX7qDUt7ngtDXe-Qw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4981297.jpg", "complexity": 3.5727, "min_players": 4, "max_players": 9, "playing_time": 180, "categories": ["Economic", "Negotiation", "Real-time", "Science Fiction", "Space Exploration"], "mechanics": ["Auction: Sealed Bid", "Hidden Victory Points", "Income", "Negotiation", "Real-Time", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Tech Trees / Tech Tracks", "Trading", "Variable Player Powers"], "types": ["strategygames"], "bestwith": [5, 6], "recommendedwith": [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 202426}, {"name": "Summoner Wars: Master Set", "yearpublished": 2011, "bayesaverage": 7.09472, "average": 7.47103, "usersrated": 11120, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/93260", "description": "Summoner Wars is a fast-playing, action-packed card game for 2-4 players in which they take on the role of Summoners: powerful beings who harness the power of mysterious Summoning Stones to lead their race to conquest on the war-torn planet of Itharia.

You will assign these ships to the orbital facilities in order to earn resources, expand your fleet, and colonize the planet.\n\nAs the game progresses, you will place your colony tokens on the planet to represent the amount of control you have over each territory. Those territories exert influence over specific orbital facilities and, if you control a territory, you are able to utilize that sway to your advantage.\n\nThe planet was once the home of an alien race and they left behind a wondrous artifact in orbit. Using your fleet to explore the artifact, you will discover amazing alien technologies that you can use to advance your cause.\n\nWinning the game will require careful consideration as you assign your fleet, integrate the alien technology and territory influences into your expansion plans, and block your opponents from building colonies of their own. Do you have what it takes to conquer an alien frontier?\n\nRoll and place your dice to gain advantages over your opponent and block them out of useful areas of the board.  Use Alien Tech cards to manipulate your dice rolls and territory bonuses to break the rules.  Steal resources, overtake territories, and do whatever it takes to get your colonies on the map first!  Don't dream it'll be easy, though, because the other players will be trying to do the same thing.", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UWZTWLXFfg_6HpXJmviL3g__small/img/KBuRMq00g4PlosEQSUUTDLzsYN8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3360924.png", "complexity": 2.5655, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 4, "playing_time": 90, "categories": ["Dice", "Science Fiction", "Space Exploration"], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Dice Rolling", "Open Drafting", "Worker Placement with Dice Workers"], "types": ["strategygames"], "bestwith": [3, 4], "recommendedwith": [2, 3, 4], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 48726}, {"name": "Small World", "yearpublished": 2009, "bayesaverage": 7.08899, "average": 7.19453, "usersrated": 74178, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/40692", "description": "In Small World, players vie for conquest and control of a world that is simply too small to accommodate them all.\n\nDesigned by Philippe Keyaerts as a fantasy follow-up to his award-winning Vinci, Small World is inhabited by a zany cast of characters such as dwarves, wizards, amazons, giants, orcs, and even humans, who use their troops to occupy territory and conquer adjacent lands in order to push the other races off the face of the earth.\n\nPicking the right combination from the 14 different fantasy races and 20 unique special powers, players rush to expand their empires - often at the expense of weaker neighbors.

Over the course of two thousand years, the temple complex was gradually expanded and became widely known as \"The Most Select of Places\" (Ipet-Isut), boasting the largest religious building in the world. Today, the site is known as Karnak, located at Luxor in modern-day Egypt.\n\nJoin ancient Pharaohs in creating and growing one of the most impressive sites the world has seen, honoring the Egyptian gods Horus, Ra, Hathor, Bastet, Thoth, and Osiris. You must carefully manage the balance of your actions, preparing for the reckoning by the goddess Maat.\n\nThe game board in Tekhenu: Obelisk of the Sun is divided into six sections, each associated with an Egyptian god: Horus, Ra, Hathor, Bastet, Thoth, and Osiris. In the center stands an impressive obelisk (Tekhenu) that casts its shadow onto different parts of the board. As a result, the area around the obelisk is divided into sunny, shaded, and dark sections, depending on how the obelisk casts its shadow at that particular moment. As the game progresses, the sun's rotation alters which sections are sunny, shaded, or dark.\n\nThe game takes place over multiple rounds. Each round, players draft dice and perform actions associated with the value of the die and the section from which the die was drafted. Dice come in five colors, and each die is considered Pure, Tainted, or Forbidden depending on the color of the die and the position of the obelisk's shadow. While you may never draft Forbidden dice, you are free to draft any other die, whether Pure or Tainted.\n\nAs you draft the dice, you must consider not only the general availability of dice &mdash; if no dice are available in a given section, then you cannot readily perform the action associated with that section &mdash; but also which value die to draft. You must also consider the purity of the dice to draft, as you must balance your Pure and Tainted actions if you want to have a more favorable position in turn order.\n\nWhen you draft a die, you can perform an action depending on the section you took the die from. Each of the actions corresponds to a different Egyptian god: Horus, Ra, Hathor, Bastet, Thoth and Osiris. Instead of a god action, you can choose to produce, generating resources based on the color and value of the die, but beware of producing in excess of your production capacity, as this is Greed and adds Taint to your balance!\n\nTwo scoring phases occur during the game, during which players earn victory points based on the workshops, quarries, buildings, statues and pillars they have built, as well as the happiness of their people and production capacity of their resources. However, players must also keep a healthy amount of resources around to sustain their population or they suffer negative consequences.", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CBLtzgG8zsqDkUZ_hN5-ew__small/img/QaUXxrgmXFrlNADgPeGhY5F538g=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5313583.jpg", "complexity": 4.0663, "min_players": 1, "max_players": 4, "playing_time": 120, "categories": ["Ancient", "Dice", "Mythology"], "mechanics": ["Action Drafting", "Income", "Open Drafting", "Pattern Building", "Turn Order: Stat-Based", "Variable Set-up"], "types": ["strategygames"], "bestwith": [3], "recommendedwith": [1, 2, 3, 4], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 297030}, {"name": "Arboretum", "yearpublished": 2015, "bayesaverage": 7.06863, "average": 7.25317, "usersrated": 23153, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/140934", "description": "Arboretum is a strategy card game for 2-4 players, aged 10 and up, that combines set collection, tile-laying and hand management while playing in about 25 minutes.

He gathered eminent mediums of his time for an extraordinary s&eacute;ance, and they have seven hours to make contact with the ghost and investigate any clues that it can provide to unlock an old mystery.\n\nUnable to talk, the amnesiac ghost communicates with the mediums through visions, which are represented in the game by illustrated cards. The mediums must decipher the images to help the ghost remember how he was murdered: Who did the crime? Where did it take place? Which weapon caused the death? The more the mediums cooperate and guess well, the easier it is to catch the right culprit.\n\nIn Mysterium, a reworking of the game system present in Tajemnicze Domostwo, one player takes the role of ghost while everyone else represents a medium. To solve the crime, the ghost must first recall (with the aid of the mediums) all of the suspects present on the night of the murder. A number of suspect, location and murder weapon cards are placed on the table, and the ghost randomly assigns one of each of these in secret to a medium.\n\nEach hour (i.e., game turn), the ghost hands one or more vision cards face up to each medium, refilling their hand to seven each time they share vision cards. These vision cards present dreamlike images to the mediums, with each medium first needing to deduce which suspect corresponds to the vision cards received. Once the ghost has handed cards to the final medium, they start a two-minute sandtimer. Once a medium has placed their token on a suspect, they may also place clairvoyancy tokens on the guesses made by other mediums to show whether they agree or disagree with those guesses.\n\nAfter time runs out, the ghost reveals to each medium whether the guesses were correct or not. Mediums who guessed correctly move on to guess the location of the crime (and then the murder weapon), while those who didn't keep their vision cards and receive new ones next hour corresponding to the same suspect. Once a medium has correctly guessed the suspect, location and weapon, they move their token to the epilogue board and receive one clairvoyancy point for each hour remaining on the clock. They can still use their remaining clairvoyancy tokens to score additional points.\n\nIf one or more mediums fail to identify their proper suspect, location and weapon before the end of the seventh hour, then the ghost has failed and dissipates, leaving the mystery unsolved. If, however, they have all succeeded, then the ghost has recovered enough of its memory to identify the culprit.\n\nMediums then group their suspect, location and weapon cards on the table and place a number by each group. The ghost then selects one group, places the matching culprit number face down on the epilogue board, picks three vision cards &mdash; one for the suspect, one for the location, and one for the weapon &mdash; then shuffles these cards. Players who have achieved few clairvoyancy points flip over one vision card at random, then secretly vote on which suspect they think is guilty; players with more points then flip over a second vision card and vote; then those with the most points see the final card and vote.\n\nIf a majority of the mediums have identified the proper suspect, with ties being broken by the vote of the most clairvoyant medium, then the killer has been identified and the ghost can now rest peacefully. If not, well, perhaps you can try again...", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1nQ3ZKudtDeAP7IiKE-kNg__small/img/sW38512N2r1ZuuPE2TUD2LNfoxM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8625343.jpg", "complexity": 1.8893, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 7, "playing_time": 42, "categories": ["Deduction", "Murder / Mystery", "Party Game", "Real-time"], "mechanics": ["Communication Limits", "Cooperative Game", "Deduction", "Finale Ending", "Hand Management", "Pattern Recognition", "Real-Time", "Storytelling", "Voting"], "types": ["thematic", "familygames"], "bestwith": [5, 6], "recommendedwith": [3, 4, 5, 6, 7], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 181304}, {"name": "Carpe Diem", "yearpublished": 2018, "bayesaverage": 7.05308, "average": 7.49754, "usersrated": 8540, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/245934", "description": "The players slip into the role of rich patricians in ancient Rome.

Over five rounds, players program their decisions about price, production, research, and expansion. The game features a unique mechanism of planning, which combines patching mechanisms with bidding and action selection. Each of the rounds consists of eight simple phases: planning, pricing, production, development, research, expansion, selling, and profits.\n\nIn the planning phase, all players simultaneously make decisions for the next year by overlaying (\"patching\") their two plan cards and all of their development tiles. The actions they plan on their cards and tiles in this phase will determine what actions they can perform during all of the later phases.\n\nIn the pricing phase, players change the price they charge for their smartphones based on their plan. A lower price helps to go earlier and sell more smartphones on the market, but a higher price, while risky, helps players to earn more money.\n\nIn production, all players produce smartphones.\n\nIn development, players take development tiles, which expand their planning possibilities in future rounds.\n\nIn research, players discover new technologies. Each technology not only expands players' ability to sell smartphones to customers, but also gives them special powers they can use during the game.\n\nIn the expansion phase, players open offices in neighbor regions, which allow them to sell in that region and develop their network of offices to more regions in further turns.\n\nIn the sale phase, players sell the phones they produced in regions where they have offices. But there is limited space in each region - and if your price is too high, cheaper rivals can block you from selling.\n\nIn the profit phase, players get income for their sales. Players gain the sale prices for all of their sold smartphones, and the player who sold the most phones in each region gains a bonus for controlling the accessory market. At the end of this phase all sold smartphones are discarded from the map - and a new round begins.\n\nAfter five rounds, the richest player wins.", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Ndctxvd7kBXYubeYRKRqzw__small/img/hJtPqShJYdb8DsdnTvpdkXrx-CU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4258616.jpg", "complexity": 2.7966, "min_players": 1, "max_players": 5, "playing_time": 90, "categories": ["Economic", "Industry / Manufacturing"], "mechanics": ["Action Queue", "Area Majority / Influence", "Layering", "Network and Route Building", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Turn Order: Stat-Based", "Variable Set-up"], "types": ["strategygames"], "bestwith": [5], "recommendedwith": [3, 4, 5], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 246684}, {"name": "Blood Bowl: Team Manager \u2013 The Card Game", "yearpublished": 2011, "bayesaverage": 7.05052, "average": 7.39945, "usersrated": 11724, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/90137", "description": "Game description from the publisher:\n\nBlood Bowl: Team Manager - The Card Game is a bone-breaking, breathtaking standalone card game of violence and outright cheating for two to four players.

Each Player represents a Taoist monk working together with the others to fight off waves of ghosts.\n\nThe players, using teamwork, will have to exorcise the ghosts that appear during the course of the game. At the beginning of his turn, a player brings a ghost into play and places it on a free spot, and more than one can come in at the same time. The ghosts all have abilities of their own &ndash; some affecting the Taoists and their powers, some causing the active player to roll the curse die for a random effect, and others haunting the villager tiles and blocking that tile's special action. On his turn, a Taoist can move on a tile in order to exorcise adjacent ghosts or to benefit from the villager living on the tile, providing it is not haunted. Each tile of the village allows the players to benefit from a different bonus. With the cemetery, for example, Taoists can bring a dead Taoist back to life, while the herbalist allows to recover spent Tao tokens, etc. It will also be possible to get traps or move ghosts or unhaunt other village tiles.\n\nTo exorcise a ghost, the Taoist rolls three Tao dice with different colors: red, blue, green, yellow, black, and white. If the result of the roll matches the color(s) of the ghost or incarnation of Wu-Feng, the exorcism succeeds. The white result is a wild color that can be used as any color. For example, to exorcise a green ghost with 3 resistance, you need to roll three green, three white, or a combination of both. If your die rolls fall short, you can also use Tao tokens that match the color in addition to your roll. You may choose to use these after your roll. Taoists gain these tokens by using certain village tiles or by exorcising certain ghosts. One of the Taoists has a power that allows him to receive such a token once per turn.\n\nTo win, the players must defeat the incarnation of Wu-Feng, a boss who arrives at the end of the game. There are also harder difficulty levels that add more incarnations of Wu-Feng, in which to win, you must defeat all of them.\n\nThere are many more ways to lose, however.

You want to issue your commands in such a way that your crews will be ready to execute them at just the right times.\n\nEach of your pre-painted capital ships has a command value, which determines how many commands it will have in its stack at any given point in time. During setup, you secretly build your initial command stack, selecting from any of four different commands, each of which provides a different advantage. Once you have locked your selections, you place the commands in your stack in the order of your choice.

Make your way across the world map, discovering new locations, interacting with memorable characters, fighting vicious monsters, and scavenging long-lost treasures. The world pulls you in through detailed descriptions and vivid artwork for each place you visit. Every location is unique, not randomized, and is built piece by piece as you explore.\n\n\n\n     Progression &mdash; Arydia is played as a campaign over the course of a number of game sessions; you start each session right where you left off! As you play, the game keeps track of your actions and decisions. Your characters will grow in power, collecting new items, weapons, and skills. NPCs and locations will change, depending on how you interact with them. All of this progression is done using a simple, but powerful, index system, which allows for quick and easy set-up and tear down.\n\n\n\n     Combat &mdash; Many of the locations you'll visit in Arydia are hostile, so you'll need your weapons, skills, and co-operation to overcome the challenges you encounter! Arydia features a tactical, co-operative combat system. Enemies are controlled by game cards and dice, while you and your companions work together to defeat them.\n\n\n\n     Role-playing &mdash; Take on the roles of a wide cast of characters as you encounter them throughout your journeys. Step into the shoes of a disgruntled shop owner, sniffling brat, or a poorly-dressed bandit leader. The incentive-based role-play system encourages you to engage in dramatic storytelling, without being intrusive.\n\n\nAs for being a \"green legacy\" game, publisher Far Off Games notes that Arydia features all the hallmarks of a legacy game &mdash; packages to open, hidden information, progression, discovery, exploration, all the while wrapping it in high-quality components &mdash; but allows you to reset the game when you have completed it so that you can start again or pass it on to someone else.", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GGXq2lRAJCtS1yPPPmdVKw__small/img/-ERrbcuFZtzZSLfl8grcDi_pCgY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6205610.png", "complexity": 3.3204, "min_players": 1, "max_players": 4, "playing_time": 240, "categories": ["Adventure", "Dice", "Exploration", "Fantasy"], "mechanics": ["Cooperative Game", "Critical Hits and Failures", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Line of Sight", "Modular Board", "Narrative Choice / Paragraph", "Role Playing", "Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Storytelling", "Tech Trees / Tech Tracks"], "types": ["thematic"], "bestwith": [2], "recommendedwith": [1, 2, 3, 4], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 219650}, {"name": "Twice as Clever!", "yearpublished": 2019, "bayesaverage": 7.03914, "average": 7.42286, "usersrated": 9918, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/269210", "description": "Doppelt so clever follows the model of 2018's Ganz sch\u00f6n clever.

Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions. Chess games can end in checkmate (when the king cannot escape from the opponent's pieces), resignation (when one player recognizes that defeat is inevitable and ends the game), or one of several types of draws.\n\nChess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices. The 2020 Netflix series, The Queen's Gambit was enjoyed by both chess players and non-players alike. There is also a large literature of books and periodicals about chess, typically featuring games and commentary by chess masters. Chess is so well known and highly regarded that it is often used as a metaphor in journalism, poetry, fiction, and film.\n\nChess has its origins in the Indian game Chaturanga, which became Shatranj when introduced to the Persians. The current form of the game emerged in the second half of the 15th century when the Persians brought Shatranj to Southern Europe.

The demon-tainted Uthuk Y'llan barbarians stalk the realm and the undead servants of Waiqar the Undying venture beyond their borders for the first time in memory. The leaders of Terrinoth are divided and fractious, unable to unite against these common threats. And in the northern barony of Forthyn, the stage is set for the next great confrontation between Terrinoth and the forces of darkness. For years, your journeys have taken you across the fantasy realm of Terrinoth, venturing into dark forests, shadowy cities, ancient crypts, and misty swamps &mdash; but your true legend is about to begin.''\n\nForge your own legend together with friends as you adventure across the vibrant fantasy realm of Terrinoth in the co-operative dungeon-crawling board game Descent: Legends of the Dark. Powered by an integrated free companion app, Descent: Legends of the Dark puts you in the role of a budding hero with their own playstyle and abilities. Together with your unlikely companions, you'll begin an unexpected adventure &mdash; an adventure told across the sixteen quests of the \"Blood and Flame\" campaign. Throughout your campaign, you'll face undead lurking in the mists, demonic barbarians stalking the wilds, and even more terrifying threats. With 46 pieces of 3D terrain and forty hero and monster miniatures to draw you into the game. Your objectives will change from quest to quest as you follow the overarching story of the campaign.\n\nCore gameplay mechanisms such as combat, fatigue, skills, items, and more have received completely new interpretations with Legends of the Dark, while a new approach to scenario layout and 3D terrain creates striking multi-level scenarios. You take three actions each turn: one maneuver action and two additional actions of your choice. Every hero also has an attack card and skill cards! Each hero starts the game with two weapon cards, which are sleeved together back-to-back to create a single attack card.  Skill cards can also be readied, switching between two complementary abilities.\n\nThe app also brings new changes to gameplay, introducing enemies with adaptable strategies, complex status effects, and triggers fully managed by the app, and the ability to develop your heroes based on the choices you make in scenarios. You'll also uncover a wealth of activity between scenarios, such as crafting, shopping in the city, upgrading equipment, and more. Because of these various differences, Descent: Legends of the Dark is not compatible with Descent: Journeys in the Dark and its expansions.\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Q96PxRVbrDxS9_4ZPTJtHQ__small/img/hXnjkvD7KiLk2fon8tbvsXNtT_k=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5941333.png", "complexity": 2.697, "min_players": 1, "max_players": 4, "playing_time": 180, "categories": ["Adventure", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Miniatures"], "mechanics": ["Cooperative Game", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Modular Board", "Movement Points", "Role Playing", "Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game", "Solo / Solitaire Game", "Square Grid", "Variable Player Powers"], "types": ["thematic"], "bestwith": [4], "recommendedwith": [1, 2, 3, 4], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 322708}, {"name": "Dice Throne: Season One ReRolled", "yearpublished": 2020, "bayesaverage": 7.01982, "average": 8.2817, "usersrated": 3097, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/291794", "description": "Dice Throne Season One ReRolled is a remastered edition of Dice Throne: Season One with two new characters!

Meanwhile, King William III of England sat easier on his new throne than he ever had before. With the Spanish succession crisis unresolved and looming, there were no illusions that the new century would be a quiet one. But neither France nor England could have anticipated the tumult of the years to come: a Second Hundred Years' War, during which these two tenacious adversaries would compete fiercely and proudly along every axis of human achievement. On battlefields from India to Canada to the Caribbean Sea their armies and fleets would clash; in the salons of Paris and the coffee-houses of London the modern world&rsquo;s politics and economics would be born; and finally a revolution would rock the foundations of society &ndash; a revolution that could have ended not in blood and terror but in a triumph of democracy and liberty that might have transformed the world beyond imagining.\n\nImperial Struggle is a two-player game depicting the 18th-century rivalry between France and Britain. It begins in 1697, as the two realms wait warily for the King of Spain to name an heir, and ends in 1789, when a new order brought down the Bastille. The game is not merely about war: both France and Britain must build the foundations of colonial wealth, deal with the other nations of Europe, and compete for glory across the span of human endeavor.\n\nImperial Struggle covers almost 100 years of history and four major wars. Yet it remains a low-complexity game, playable in a short evening. It aims to honor its spiritual ancestor, Twilight Struggle, by pushing further in the direction of simple rules and playable systems, while maintaining global scope and historical sweep in the scope of a single evening. In peace turns, players build their economic interests and alliances, and take advantage of historical events represented by Event cards. They must choose their investments wisely, but also with an eye to denying these opportunities to their opponent. In war turns, each theater can bring great rewards of conquest and prestige, but territorial gains can disappear at the treaty table. At the end of the century, will the British rule an empire on which the sun never sets? Or will France light the way for the world, as the superpower of the Sun King's dreams or the republic of Lafayette's?\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FTE7dxVd4jQaIwwRcCQcRw__small/img/ydG55mHxOdtN5RFN9B9z7qAgLBI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5291148.jpg", "complexity": 4.0622, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 2, "playing_time": 240, "categories": ["Age of Reason", "American Revolutionary War", "Wargame"], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Events", "Open Drafting", "Point to Point Movement", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Simulation"], "types": ["wargames", "strategygames"], "bestwith": [2], "recommendedwith": [2], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 206480}, {"name": "Mage Wars Arena", "yearpublished": 2012, "bayesaverage": 7.0164, "average": 7.56649, "usersrated": 7985, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/101721", "description": "What would it be like for Mages of vastly different schools and philosophies of magic to come together in an arena and fight to the death? How would an Illusionist battle a Druid? Or a Warlock fight a Beastmaster? Or a Priestess fare against a Wizard?\n\nMage Wars &mdash; redubbed Mage Wars Arena in 2015 to distinguish it from Mage Wars Academy &mdash; pits powerful Mages against each other in deadly arena combat. Each Mage uses his own fully-customizable book of spells to achieve total victory over his opponent. Summon mighty creatures to do battle in your name; cast powerful spells to attack your foe and thwart his every plan and strategy; use hidden enchantments to turn the tables and rule the day; adorn yourself with mighty weapons, armor, and arcane artifacts &ndash; all of this and more await you in the arena of Mage Wars!\n\nMage Wars is a tactical board game, a combination of a card game and miniatures game, combining the best elements from each genre. The game is played on an arena game board divided into square areas called \"zones\", which regulate movement and the placement of objects. Each Mage (player) starts in a corner of the arena, opposite his enemy.\n\nEach player holds a spellbook, from which spell cards are pulled out as they are cast during the game. This has the feel of being a real Mage, turning the pages of your tome of magic, as you plan your strategy each turn. A point system allows you to choose spells for your spellbook, with more powerful spells and spells outside your schools of training costing more points. You have full access to cast any spell you want each turn, allowing for an unprecedented level of rich strategy and tactics. Many of these spells &ndash; such as creatures, equipment, and enchantments &ndash; are placed on the board and become objects in the game. Creatures can move around the arena, and attack each other and the enemy Mage. Attacks deal damage, as well as interesting special effects such as Burn, Corrode, Stun, Daze, Push, Cripple, Paralyze, etc. Creatures can be destroyed when they receive too much damage, or can be controlled by powerful curses and enchantments, or contained by walls and other creatures.\n\nEvery Mage comes from a different school of magic, each with unique spells and strategies:\n\n\n    The Beastmaster will try to rush and swarm the enemy with his hordes of animals, buffed by his nature enchantments.\n    The Warlock will go right for the throat, armed with his powerful Lash of Hellfire, Helm of Fear, and Demonhide Armor. Along the way to the enemy Mage, he'll use his curses and fire attacks to contain and destroy enemy creatures.\n    The Wizard is a trickster, a master of meta-magic: countering, stealing, redirecting, and destroying enemy spells and mana. He's also a master of teleportation and portals/gates.\n    The Priestess will defend with knights and angels and powerful healing and protection spells. She'll wear down the enemy, then overwhelm them in the end.\n\n\nThe base game comes with all you need to get started: spellbooks, extra spells to customize with the spellbooks, arena game board, dice, markers, etc.\n\nNew Mages will be released every few months to add new spells, powers, and variety to the game.

To accomplish this, players place route markers on the board to connect passengers to their destinations.  However, the destination types (work, bar, home) vary from turn to turn, so you can follow certain passengers as they make their way through the daily grind.\n\nPlayers may buy more buses (they start off with one), build onto their bus route, bring new passengers to the city (via the trains), expand the city by adding more buildings, and run their buses. There is another option, the clock. The action board has one other clever feature. On some actions, route expansion and building, the first player to choose that action actually gets to execute the action last! Which leads to some interesting games of chicken and some painful decisions.\n\nBuying more buses allows a player to carry one more passenger every time they run their buses - hence scoring, in the best case, one more point. Depending on how the city gets built, however, finding lots of passengers on the street can be tricky.\n\nBus routes extend from either end of a Settlers-style initial placement. Extensions are appended to either end. Routes may only run parallel if there are no empty streets at one of the ends or the line ends on the crossing as another player's end. All new passengers will arrive at one of two train stations so that is one concern when route building. One must also be careful to run by a nice mix of building types.

Wealth is not the only path to success as players bluff and bargain with each other to acquire the Assets they covet.\n\nThe Arena Phase is when the bloody games are held. Gladiators from two rival Houses are pitted against each other in a brutal fight for glory. The spectacles of the games are represented by miniature combat on the arena board. Fighters pit their Attack, Defense and Speed dice against one another to determine the victor. All players seek to increase their fortunes by betting on the outcome of the gruesome conflict. Fighters who emerge from the arena victorious gain Favor and their Dominus gain Influence.\n\nThe goal of the game is to become the most influential house in Capua, securing your family&rsquo;s power for years to come.  During the game, players will bribe, poison, betray, steal, blackmail, and undermine each other. Gold will change hands again and again to buy support, stay someone&rsquo;s hand or influence their decisions. Will you be the honorable player whose word is their bond or the treacherous schemer whose alliances change with the wind?\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_nPXf80oO-wC8eW2drZx1Q__small/img/jxw0q-ua1ix06a8HUM0X5FLpHJA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6166144.jpg", "complexity": 2.7311, "min_players": 3, "max_players": 4, "playing_time": 180, "categories": ["Ancient", "Dice", "Fighting", "Miniatures", "Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Negotiation"], "mechanics": ["Auction / Bidding", "Betting and Bluffing", "Bribery", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Hand Management", "Movement Points", "Sudden Death Ending", "Trading", "Variable Player Powers"], "types": ["thematic"], "bestwith": [4], "recommendedwith": [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 128671}, {"name": "Endeavor", "yearpublished": 2009, "bayesaverage": 6.99864, "average": 7.37025, "usersrated": 9665, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/33160", "description": "It is a time when the maps of the world are still being filled in.

Players earn glory by increasing their scores in Industry, Culture, Finance, and Politics, as well as by occupying cities, controlling connections between cities, and by holding certain Asset Cards and Building Tiles.

During the action phase, players take turns to either activate a building using a population marker or spend trade tokens to take an action: Ship, Occupy, Attack, Payment or Draw. Some buildings and tokens allow a player to take one or both of two actions. Shipping is used to open new regions for Occupation and Drawing, and gains you Trade Tokens. Once a shipping track is full, the player with the most influence in that region gains the powerful Governor card for that region. Occupation of a city results in glory and Trade Tokens, while Attacking steals a city from an opponent! Either Occupation or Attacking can result in claiming the connection between two cities, if both connected cities are controlled by the same player.

In addition, you must be on good terms with the powerful bishop, who can help you in your quest.\n\nOUTLINE OF GAME PLAY\nThe object of the game is to score the most Victory Points. You win Victory Points by winning any of the 5 categories: Illuminators, Scribes, Manuscripts, Scrolls, and Supplies. You win a category by having the highest total number of workers (Scribes, Illuminators) or resources (Manuscripts, Scrolls, Supplies) in that category. This is determined by the numbers in the upper left corner on the cards. At the start of the game, each category is worth 3 Victory Points. As the game progresses, the values on the Value Board will change and some categories will become worth more or fewer Victory Points than others. The game is divided into 2 stages: a Donation stage and an Auction stage. During the Donation stage, players acquire free cards according to an established plan. In the Auction stage, players purchase cards in auction rounds. After the two stages, winners of each category are determined and Victory Points awarded. The player with the most Victory Points wins.\n\nGAME CHARACTERISTICS\nThe game involves a good deal of strategic planning, some bluffing, and a little bit of luck.

The deck of 110 cards consists of production buildings (indigo, sugar, tobacco, coffee, and silver) and \"violet\" buildings that grant special powers or extra victory points. Cards from the hand can be either built or used as money to build something else; cards from the deck are used to represent goods produced by the production buildings, in which case they are left face-down. A seven-card hand limit is enforced once per round.\n\nIn each round (or governorship), each player in turn selects from one of the available roles, triggering an event that usually affects all players, such as producing goods or constructing buildings. The person who picks the role gets a privilege, such as producing more goods or building more cheaply.\n\nThough similar in concept to Puerto Rico, the game has many different mechanisms.

The stronger ones were able to resist total annihilation but even their prodigious power could not save them entirely. As the survivors fell from the broken mountain, the shards of their divinity and the remnants of those that did not survive were scattered to the 4 corners of a now broken world.\n\nAs they awoke, each god found themselves to be but a shadow of their former selves. They were still mighty, stronger than any mortal that yet walked but they were no longer all powerful, no longer immortal. Each one could sense the fragments of power that had now fallen to the Earth and that by collecting these they could regain their former grandeur and, if they could but amass enough, stand at the front of a new Pantheon, reshaped in their image.\n\nThe world around them suffered as much as they did, the power released during the epic battle had ignited a cataclysm that reduced the beautiful land of Greece to a barren wasteland. Athens burns, Crete has sunken below the waves of the roiling seas and the immortal mount Olympus is now an ash covered wreck of its former glory. But this Event has not only affected the mortal realms. The underworld trembled from the blow even as a legion of fresh souls ran down the river Styx. Would that have been the extent of the underworld's involvement however...\n\nHades, having lost the majority of his power, no longer holds sway over the Underworld. The gates of hell are open and even though the River Styx prevents the weakest souls from regaining the mortal world, the strongest warriors, the mightiest heroes and the most vicious monsters have managed to claw their way back up the Styx and back to the surface.\n\nAs a new power struggle breaks out, Gods summon mortal survivors, returned heroes and reborn monsters to their side in their hunt for the shards of their lost power.\n\nIn Mythic Battles: Pantheon, it is these clashes between warbands, in the midst of a post-apocalyptic ancient Greece, that are the focal point of the game. Choose your God, draft your warband and take the fight to your enemies with the might of the most powerful beings from Greek mythology at your back.", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/au7lklR-A_0nnTskm4Vohw__small/img/MPylcXlXo-YF-rsanQIy9DaaGcs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3235453.jpg", "complexity": 3.0602, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 4, "playing_time": 90, "categories": ["Ancient", "Card Game", "Fighting", "Miniatures", "Mythology"], "mechanics": ["Area Movement", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Command Cards", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Line of Sight", "Open Drafting", "Player Elimination", "Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game", "Simulation", "Team-Based Game", "Variable Player Powers"], "types": ["strategygames"], "bestwith": [2], "recommendedwith": [2, 3, 4], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 186751}, {"name": "Galaxy Trucker: Anniversary Edition", "yearpublished": 2012, "bayesaverage": 6.97689, "average": 8.14201, "usersrated": 2953, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/140068", "description": "In a galaxy far, far away... they need sewer systems, too.

As the clock ticks and Hitler's ambitions grow, these daring few must build their strength and prepare for the perfect moment to strike. The Gestapo hound their trail, calling these conspirators \"Schwarze Kapelle\", the Black Orchestra. Will this band of daring patriots save their country from utter ruin before it is too late?\n\nBlack Orchestra begins with each player choosing a historic figure involved in the conspiracy against Hitler. In this dark and dangerous pursuit, motivation is perhaps your greatest weapon. If you can stay true to your convictions in the face of overwhelming threat and inspire your comrades, then you will be able to use your special ability, attempt plots, and even become zealous (necessary for some extremely daring plots).\n\nBut every move you make may also increase the suspicion of the authorities. The Gestapo will make routine sweeps, and any players with high suspicion will be arrested and interrogated (possibly resulting in other players being arrested). If you are all arrested or if the Gestapo finds your secret papers, you lose. And the suspicion placed on each conspirator will increase the chances their plots are detected.\n\nOn a turn, players may take three actions, such as moving, searching for an item, or drawing a card; or, at the cost of one action per die, roll the dice in an attempt to gain even more actions &mdash; at the risk of attracting the suspicion of the gestapo. This dice rolling \"Conspire\" action allows players to make bold moves when most needed.\n\nAfter the actions have been taken, an event card is drawn. The game is played over seven stages of World War 2, represented by seven stacks of event cards. These cards walk you through the events of WWII in a roughly (but not strictly) chronological order. New stages open up new areas of the board, cause Hitler and his deputies to interact with the Conspirators, and present various opportunities or threats. During the final stage, many board spaces become off-limits, as the Allies move closer to Germany.\n\nTo win, players must collect a plot card and fulfill all necessary requirements listed (such as having Hitler be in a certain space and possessing certain items--detonator & fuse, etc.). The active player may then attempt the plot by rolling the indicated dice, including all additional modifiers and helpful Action cards. The total of number of \"Target\" symbols needed to kill Hitler is based on Hitler's military support, but a Conspirator's security level decides if any \"Eagles\" rolled will see them detected, and foil the plot regardless. Players must consider their ability to successfully complete a plot and the relative suspicion levels of the different Conspirators involved.\n\nPlayers will need to work together and agree on the wisest course of action, as well as have a little luck, to succeed. The phenomenon of one player dominating the game because of its cooperative nature is mitigated by the fact that there are no certainties, and often a player will need to make a bold or reckless move to keep the conspiracy alive. Cool heads often prevail, but play it too cool and you may miss your chance. The co-operative dynamic gets really interesting if a player is ever arrested, and fails to resist interrogation, then they will need to make a big decision all by themselves, without revealing their options to the group.

Stockpile centers on the idea that nobody knows everything about the stock market, but everyone does know something. In the game, this philosophy manifests in two ways: insider information and the stockpile.\n\nFirst, players are given insider information each round. This information dictates how a stock&rsquo;s value will change at the end of the round. By privately learning if a stock is going to move up or down, each player has a chance to act ahead of the market by buying or selling at the right time.\n\nSecond, players purchase their stocks by bidding on piles of cards called stockpiles. These stockpiles will contain a mixture of face-up and face-down cards placed by other players in the game. In this way, nobody will know all of the cards in the stockpiles. Not all cards are good either. Trading fees can poison the piles by making players pay more than they bid. By putting stocks and other cards up for auction, Stockpile catalyzes player interaction, especially when potential profits from insider information are on the line.\n\nBoth of these mechanisms are combined with some stock market elements to make players consider multiple factors when selling a stock. Do you hold onto a stock in hopes of catching a lucrative stock split or do you sell now to avoid the potential company bankruptcy? Can you hold onto your stock until the end of the game to become the majority shareholder, or do you need the liquidity of cash now for future bidding? Do you risk it all by investing heavily into one company, or do you mitigate your risk by diversifying your portfolio?\n\nIn the end, everyone knows something about the stock market, so it all comes down to strategy execution. Will you be able to navigate the movements of the stock market with certainty? Or will your investments go under from poor predictions?", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/T7CvF_oFrEMNgS0Eyrbr5g__small/img/8ebaZ-3iSTwY0mvlc8FFULp8B4k=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2537618.jpg", "complexity": 2.1208, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 5, "playing_time": 45, "categories": ["Economic"], "mechanics": ["Auction / Bidding", "Auction: Fixed Placement", "Betting and Bluffing", "Commodity Speculation", "Constrained Bidding", "Investment", "Market", "Open Drafting", "Stock Holding", "Victory Points as a Resource"], "types": ["strategygames"], "bestwith": [4, 5], "recommendedwith": [3, 4, 5], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 161614}, {"name": "Clash of Cultures", "yearpublished": 2012, "bayesaverage": 6.96087, "average": 7.56662, "usersrated": 5913, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/40765", "description": "From Christian Marcussen, the creator of Merchants and Marauders, comes Clash of Cultures, a civilization game in which each player leads a civilization from a single settlement to a mighty empire.

Each player starts with a hand of random bean cards, and each card has a number on it corresponding to the number of that type of beans in the deck. Unlike in most other card games, you can't rearrange the order of cards in hand, so you must use them in the order that you've picked them up from the deck &mdash; unless you can trade them to other players, which is the heart of the game.\n\nOn a turn, you must plant the first one or two cards in your hand into the \"fields\" in front of you. Each field can hold only one type of bean, so if you must plant a type of bean that's not in one of your fields, then you must harvest a field to make room for the new arrival. This usually isn't good! Next, you reveal two cards from the deck, and you can then trade these cards as well as any card in your hand for cards from other players. You can even make future promises for cards received right now! After all the trading is complete &mdash; and all trades on a turn must involve the active player &mdash; then you end your turn by drawing cards from the deck and placing them at the back of your hand.\n\nWhen you harvest beans, you receive coins based on the number of bean cards in that field and the \"beanometer\" for that particular type of bean. Flip over 1-4 cards from that field to transform them into coins, then place the remainder of the cards in the discard pile. When the deck runs out, shuffle the discards, playing through the deck two more times.

Colored sand is laid to create a symbolic map of the world before the pattern is ceremonially destroyed and the sand cast into the river.\n\nIn the two-player game Mandala, you are trying to score more than your opponent by collecting valuable cards &mdash; but you won't know which cards are valuable until well into the game! Over the course of the game, players play their colored cards into the two mandalas, building the central shared mountains and laying cards into their own fields. As soon as a mandala has all six colors, the players take turns choosing the colors in the mountain and adding those cards to their \"river\" and \"cup\". At the end of the game, the cards in your cup are worth points based on the position of their colors in that player's river. The player whose cup is worth more points wins.\n\nThe linen playmat shows two circular mandalas, with each being divided by a horizontal space (the mountain) to create one \"field\" for each player. The playmat has seven spaces in front of each player to hold their river of single face-up cards and their cup: the stack of face-down cards which they score at the end of the game.\n\nTo begin, each player receives a hand of six cards. Each player receives two random cards face down in their cup, then two random cards are dealt face up into the central mountain strip of each mandala.\n\nOn your turn, you may play either a single card into one of mountains, or one or more matching cards into one of your fields. All cards played into a mandala must follow the \"Rule of Color\": Once a color has been played into one of the three areas of a mandala, then later cards of the same color can be played only into that same area. Thus, once your opponent has played red cards into their field, then you can't play red cards in your field, and neither you nor your opponent can play red cards into the central mountain. If you played a card into a mountain, draw three new cards from the deck at the end of your turn; if you played cards into one of your fields, do not draw new cards.\n\nA mandala is completed once it contains all six colors of cards. When this happens, the players \"destroy\" the mandala, taking turns to choose a color present in the mountain and claim all cards of that color. Whoever played more cards in their field chooses first; if tied, the player who did not complete the mandala chooses first. The first time you claim cards of a specific color, lay one of these cards in the lowest-valued empty space in your river, then place the rest into your cup. The spaces in your river are valued 1-6 in order, so cards of the first color you claim will be worth 1 point each, cards of the second color you claim worth 2 points each, and so on.\n\nOnce a mandala has been destroyed and all the colors in the mountain claimed, cards played in the fields are discarded, two new cards are dealt face up into the mountain, and the game continues.\n\nThe end of the game is triggered either when the deck is exhausted or when one player adds a sixth color to their river. Both players then tally the value of all the cards in their cup, based on the position of the colors in their river, and whoever has the higher score wins!\n\nContents:\n\n     1 linen playmat\n     108 mandala cards (18 in each of 6 colours)\n     2 reference cards", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FZUJ_Ieaw83mpz1eL-dY_g__small/img/o8B080rjfGtNloX7wMa_IRthuXo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5056121.jpg", "complexity": 1.78, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 2, "playing_time": 20, "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Card Game"], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Hand Management", "Selection Order Bid", "Set Collection"], "types": ["abstracts", "familygames"], "bestwith": [2], "recommendedwith": [2], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 264241}, {"name": "No Thanks!", "yearpublished": 2004, "bayesaverage": 6.95392, "average": 7.07996, "usersrated": 29758, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12942", "description": "No Thanks! is a card game designed to be as simple as it is engaging.\n\nThe rules are simple.

After a few minutes, gunfire and hurrying footsteps on the roof can be heard. Heavily armed bandits have come to rob honest citizens of their wallets and jewels. Will they succeed in stealing the suitcase holding the Nice Valley Coal Company's weekly pay, despite it having been placed under the supervision of Marshal Samuel Ford? Will these bandits hinder one another more than the Marshal since only the richest one of them can come out on top?\n\nIn Colt Express, you play a bandit robbing a train at the same time as other bandits, and your goal is to become the richest outlaw of the Old West. The game consists of five rounds, and each round has two phases:\n\n\n    Phase 1: Schemin' Each player plays 2-5 action cards on a common pile, with the cards being face up or face down depending on the type of the round. Instead of playing a card, a player can draw three cards from her deck.\n    Phase 2: Stealin' The action cards are carried out in the order they were played, with a player's best laid plans possibly not panning out due to mistakes and oversights!\n\n\nThe game takes place in a 3D train in which the bandits can move from one car to another, run on the roof, punch the other bandits, shoot them, rob the passengers, or draw the Marshal out of position. The train has as many cars as the number of players, and each car is seeded with gems, bags of loot or suitcases at the start of play.\n\nEach player starts a round with six cards in hand, with each card showing one of these actions. At the start of a round, a round card is revealed, showing how many cards will be played; whether they'll be played face up or face down, or individually or in pairs; and what action will occur at the end of the round (e.g., all bandits on top of the train move to the engine). You can pick up loot, gems or suitcases only by playing a \"steal\" card when you're in a train car that holds one of these items &mdash; but since everyone is planning to get these goods, you'll need to move, punch and shoot to get others out of your way. You can punch someone only in the same car as you, and when you do, the other bandit drops one of the goods he's collected and is knocked into an adjacent car.\n\nEach player's character has a special power, such as starting the round with an extra card, playing your first card face down, or pocketing a bag of loot when you punch someone instead of letting it hit the ground.\n\nYou can shoot someone in an adjacent car or (if you're running on top of the train) anyone in sight, and when you do, you give that player one of your six bullet cards; that card gets shuffled in the opponent's deck, possibly giving her a dead card in hand on a future turn and forcing her to draw instead of playing something. If the Marshal ends up in the same car as you, likely due to other bandits luring him through the train, he'll be happy to give you a bullet, too.\n\nAt the end of the game, whoever fired the most bullets receives a $1,000 braggart bonus, and whoever bagged the richest haul wins!", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2HKX0QANk_DY7CIVK5O5fQ__small/img/zcjkqn_HYDIIyVAZaAxJIkurQRg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2869710.jpg", "complexity": 1.8344, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 6, "playing_time": 40, "categories": ["American West", "Fighting", "Trains"], "mechanics": ["Action Queue", "Hand Management", "Memory", "Programmed Movement", "Take That", "Turn Order: Progressive", "Variable Player Powers"], "types": ["familygames"], "bestwith": [5, 6], "recommendedwith": [3, 4, 5, 6], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 158899}, {"name": "Scholars of the South Tigris", "yearpublished": 2023, "bayesaverage": 6.95203, "average": 8.01718, "usersrated": 3271, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/367041", "description": "Scholars of the South Tigris is set during the height of the Abbasid Caliphate, circa 830 AD.

Compete against other players as you try to build the most efficient set of factories in the shortest time. You must carefully manage your blueprints, train your workers, and manufacture as many goods as possible in order to achieve industrial dominance!\n\nIn Fantastic Factories, you race to manufacture the most goods or build the most prestigious buildings. There are elements of dice rolling, worker placement, engine building, resource management, tableau building, simultaneous play, and some card drafting. Each round is split into two phases, the market phase and the work phase.\n\nDuring the market phase, you choose to either acquire a new blueprint for free or pay to hire a contractor. Blueprints are used to construct new factories during the work phase. Contractors can be used to reinforce your strategy by providing resources or allowing you to roll additional dice. You need to be mindful of what cards are available in the marketplace and the strategies your opponents may be pursuing.\n\nDuring the work phase, all players simultaneously roll their dice and use their dice as workers to run factories. Factories start as blueprints and need to be constructed. Once constructed, each factory can be used once each turn. Worker placement can happen in any order and figuring out the correct sequence can enable a powerful chain of actions. Additionally, you can build training facilities that allow you to manipulate the dice values of your workers. Each work phase is like solving a unique worker placement puzzle in order to optimize your output of resources and goods.\n\nOnce any player has manufactured 12 goods or constructed 10 buildings, the game end is triggered and one additional and final round is played. The player with the most points wins (combination of building prestige and manufactured goods). With over 30 unique blueprints and countless synergies across buildings, each game is unique.

The warriors include 30 plastic figures, including World War II soldiers, futuristic robots, aliens, a T-Rex-riding orc, a large dragon, and many more.  Each hero or squad has its own card that details both movement and combat abilities.\n\nThere are 2 large ruins and 85 tiles of terrain in the base game.  Some terrain tiles are large (up to 24 hexes) while others are small (1 hex).  There are water, sand, rock and grass tiles (in roughly increasing order).  Many different battlefields can be built by attaching and stacking the tiles.\n\nThe rulebook features two games: a basic and a master version.  In the basic version (designed for younger players < 8 years), characters move, attack, defend, and have range -- but there are no special powers and some other rules are minimized and/or eliminated.  The master game includes special powers, wounds, engagement rules, falling rules, and a few other additions.\n\nA battlefield/scenario book shows how to build five battlefields, layer by layer.  Each battlefield may have multiple scenarios, where the goals vary.  It can be opponent elimination, getting to a certain space, protecting a certain figure, or holding out for a certain number of turns.\n\nEach unit in the Master Set has a movement rating ranging from 4 to 8, which is the number of hexes it can move in a turn.  Moving up a level counts as a hex; moving down does not incur that penalty. Moving down more levels than your height when moving from one hex to another counts as falling and you might take damage --unless you are falling into water.\n\nCombat in the game is fairly straightforward.  You roll attack dice as listed on your unit's card (1 to 8 dice in the Master Set), and the opponent rolls defense dice equal to the number on their unit's card (1 to 9 dice).  Skulls rolled in excess of shields count as wounds (hero figures may have more than one Life).\n\nThe master game uses a point system in which players alternate drafting cards until they reach the pre-assigned point value for the scenario.  It's possible to bring a \"pre-fab\" army to the battle in order to save time.\n\nThe basic game is for two players. The master game is for 2 to 4 (and more) players.\nThe game is eminently customizable, with many expansions which add more abilities, terrain, and options.

Players build lots by paying money and placing a die of the value matching the one shown on the lot's space onto the lot, along with a casino tile of one of 7 colors. Adjoining lots of the same color are considered a single casino. The casino's boss is the player whose die value is higher than any other in the casino. On each players turn, players turn over a new card representing a new lot they get. The card also is one of the casino colors. Any built casinos of the matching color will score both money and points. Money is earned for each lot in the casino, where each lot may be owned by a different player. Points go only to the casino's owner.

The steamship SS Atlantica is two days out from port on its voyage across the Atlantic Ocean. Its unsuspecting passengers fully anticipated a calm journey to Boston, Massachusetts, with nothing out of the ordinary to look forward to. However, strange nightmares plague the minds of the people aboard the ship every night; rumors circulate of dark shapes following closely behind the ship just beneath the waves; and tensions rise when a body is discovered in the ship's chapel, signs of a strange ritual littered around the corpse.\n\nLurking within the depths of the Atlantic Ocean are a swarm of vicious, unspeakable horrors: the Deep Ones, led by Mother Hydra and Father Dagon. For reasons unknown, they have set their sights on the Atlantica, and their minions, taking the form of human-Deep One hybrids, have infiltrated the steamship to help sink it from within. Each game of Unfathomable has one or more players assuming the role of one of these hybrids, and how well they can secretly sabotage the efforts of the other players might mean the difference between a successful voyage and a sunken ship.\n\nIf you're a human, you need to fend off Deep Ones, prevent the Atlantica from taking too much damage, and carefully manage the ship's four crucial resources if you want any hope of making it to Boston, all while trying to figure out which of your fellow players are friends and which are foes. Everyone shares the same resource pool, but humans will try to preserve them while traitors will strive to subtly deplete them. Being able to tell when someone is purposefully draining the group's resources is harder than you think, especially when you take crises into account!\n\nAt the end of each player's turn, that player must draw a mythos card. Each of these cards represents a crisis that the whole group must try to resolve together. Some of these crises, such as \"Food Rationing\", call for a choice that could potentially put the ship's passengers or resources at risk, while others, such as \"Hull Leak\", call for a skill test in which failure could have disastrous consequences.\n\nDuring a skill test, each player contributes skill cards from their hand to a face-down pile shared by the group. Once everyone has contributed (or chosen not to), the cards are shuffled, then revealed. If enough of the correct skills were contributed, then the group passes the test! But if the wrong skills were contributed, they can actually hinder the results, leading to failure. Thus, skill tests are dangerous opportunities for traitors to sabotage the humans' efforts, so you have to stay on your toes at all times.\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_kZDRdv3tONk9vTcA_OwSA__small/img/_8WyQKScotYGRBbKT1ypXnH2YiA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8317346.png", "complexity": 3.132, "min_players": 3, "max_players": 6, "playing_time": 240, "categories": ["Bluffing", "Deduction", "Fantasy", "Horror", "Novel-based"], "mechanics": ["Area Movement", "Hand Management", "Hidden Roles", "Team-Based Game", "Traitor Game", "Variable Player Powers"], "types": ["thematic"], "bestwith": [5], "recommendedwith": [4, 5, 6], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 340466}, {"name": "CATAN: Seafarers", "yearpublished": 1997, "bayesaverage": 6.90906, "average": 7.15876, "usersrated": 20829, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/325", "description": "This is an expansion for CATAN.

Enter a vast, underwater cosmos: a mysterious interconnected world of sharp teeth, glowing eyes, and black ink, where your survival depends on your ability to adapt to the unknown.  The foundation of the oceanic food chain are billions of one-celled organisms called phytoplankton that capture the sun's energy through photosynthesis. Every other species in the ocean is a predator, each bigger than the next, all the way up to the dreaded Apex Predator. And even bigger than Apex Predators are enormous Whales that gently swim through the ocean scooping up everything in their path. This ecosystem mimics the known world near the surface. But there is more if you are willing to dive deeper.\n\nOceans is an interactive engine builder, where players evolve their species in a continually changing ecosystem. Players must adapt their interconnected ecosystem to survive against the inevitable march of time (Aging), as well as a multitude of predators looking for food.\n\nDuring the first half of the game, players use traits from a deck of Surface cards to modify their species. These traits were chosen for their rich thematic interconnections, providing synergistic card play that mimics an oceanic ecosystem. The Surface traits bring stability to the game environment.

Details on why this is important in the description.\n\nRisk Legacy represents what is if not a new, at least a rare concept to boardgaming: campaigning. At its core, the game, particularly at first, plays much like regular Risk with a few changes. Players control countries or regions on a map of the world, and through simple combat (with players rolling dice to determine who loses units in each battle) they try to eliminate all opponents from the game board or control a certain number of \"red stars\", otherwise known as victory points (VPs).\n\nWhat's different is that Risk Legacy' changes over time based on the outcome of each game and the various choices made by players. In each game, players choose one of five factions; each faction has uniquely shaped pieces, and more importantly, different rules. At the start of the first game, each of these factions gains the ability to break one minor rule, such as the ability to move troops at any time during your turn, as opposed to only at the end.\n\nWhat makes this game unique is that when powers are chosen, players must choose one of their faction's two powers, affix that power's sticker to their faction card, then destroy the card that has the other rule on it &ndash; and by destroy, the rules mean what they say: \"If a card is DESTROYED, it is removed from the game permanently. Rip it up. Throw it in the trash.\" This key concept permeates through the game. Some things you do in a game will affect it temporarily, while others will affect it permanently. These changes may include boosting the resources of a country (for recruiting troops in lieu of the older \"match three symbols\" style of recruiting), adding bonuses or penalties to defending die rolls to countries, or adding permanent continent troop bonuses that may affect all players.\n\nThe rule book itself is also designed to change as the game continues, with blocks of blank space on the pages to allow for rules additions or changes. Entire sections of rules will not take effect until later in the game. The game box contains different sealed packages and compartments, each with a written condition for opening. The rule book indicates that these contain the rule additions, additional faction powers, and other things that should not be discussed here for spoiler protection.\n\nThe winner of each of the first 15 games receives a \"major bonus,\" such as founding a major city (which only he will be allowed to start on in future games), deleting a permanent modifier from the board, destroying a country card (preventing it from providing any resources towards purchasing troops in future games), changing a continent troop bonus, or naming a continent, which gives that player a troop bonus in future games. Players who did not win but were not eliminated are allowed to make minor changes to the world, such as founding a minor city or adding resources to a country.\n\nIt should be noted that although cards are ripped up over the course of the game, there are so many cards added via the sealed packages, that the game does not suffer. Nor is this a \"disposable\" game, merely a customized one. The game can continue to change beyond the 15 game campaign, and even when it finally does stop changing, you still have a copy of Risk that is completely unique.\n\nInitial games take approximately 30-90 minutes to play, which includes a brief rules explanation and setup.", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LxKu8_oihOQftb2npGvWMw__small/img/-g2SLefjovkUxW7H6sFOmAMjfA4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1196938.jpg", "complexity": 2.5845, "min_players": 3, "max_players": 5, "playing_time": 60, "categories": ["Science Fiction", "Wargame"], "mechanics": ["Area Movement", "Dice Rolling", "Legacy Game", "Open Drafting", "Player Elimination", "Variable Player Powers"], "types": ["strategygames"], "bestwith": [5], "recommendedwith": [4, 5], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 105134}, {"name": "Railroad Ink: Deep Blue Edition", "yearpublished": 2018, "bayesaverage": 6.89858, "average": 7.15267, "usersrated": 14427, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/245654", "description": "In the multiplayer puzzle game Railroad Ink, your goal is to connect as many exits on your board as possible.

These cards can be played either as actions or as resource generators, and players need to optimize their resources and finances in order to support their best version of the story and their relationship with Mozart.\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0aS85HPSKKGHGVvWQEEZew__small/img/Vxx4SHednYKXpDMP6eHTK9DqmSc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6795274.jpg", "complexity": 3.1667, "min_players": 1, "max_players": 4, "playing_time": 90, "categories": ["Music"], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Deck, Bag, and Pool Building", "End Game Bonuses", "Movement Points", "Multi-Use Cards", "Open Drafting"], "types": ["strategygames"], "bestwith": [3], "recommendedwith": [1, 2, 3, 4], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 348450}, {"name": "Charterstone", "yearpublished": 2017, "bayesaverage": 6.89757, "average": 7.18252, "usersrated": 15200, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/197376", "description": "The prosperous Kingdom of Greengully, ruled for centuries by the Forever King, has issued a decree to its citizens to colonize the vast lands beyond its borders.

If a player brings the score of a color to 18, they immediately take another turn. At the end of their turn, they refill their rack to six tiles.

Following in the footsteps of the first edition, the second edition refines the intuitive and exciting core formula of maneuvering your ships into position by placing a central focus on the visceral thrill of flying starships in the Star Wars galaxy.\n\nDuring a battle, you&rsquo;ll use your squadron&rsquo;s unique capabilities to give yourself an advantage in the thick of combat. Each X-Wing ship flies differently, with its own set of maneuvers ranging from gentle banks to aggressive Koiogran turns. As in the game&rsquo;s first edition, you&rsquo;ll need to use every ship&rsquo;s maneuvering capabilities to the fullest in order to strategically position your ships. A round begins with players secretly selecting a maneuver on each of their ships&rsquo; unique maneuver dials. Once you&rsquo;ve decided how each of your ships is going to fly, you&rsquo;ll begin revealing the dials and moving your ships, starting with the lowest skilled pilots.\n\nAs you move, you&rsquo;ll enter a tense duel with your opponent as you both try to line up the perfect shot. Before you can open fire on an opponent&rsquo;s ship, however, they must be in your firing arc and within range. By carefully selecting your maneuvers, you can get enemy ships in your sights, and once you&rsquo;ve locked onto your target, you&rsquo;re free to choose your plan of attack. You might pepper the enemy with blaster fire to whittle away their shields. Or, you could go for massive damage and launch a devastating volley of proton torpedoes. No matter how you approach the battle, you have complete control of your squadron. One player wins when all of their opponent&rsquo;s ships are destroyed!\n\nSlick flying is certainly important, but it isn&rsquo;t the only consideration you&rsquo;ll have to make in the midst of a dogfight. As in the first edition of X-Wing, once your ships have completed a maneuver, you can also perform an action to gain the upper hand. Whether you choose to acquire a target lock on a rival ship or barrel roll out of an enemy&rsquo;s firing arc, the actions you take affect the course of the battle and determine the fate of your squadron.\n\nNow, in the second edition of the game, your actions offer greater strategic depth than ever before. Some actions are red and induce stress when they are used. Other actions may be linked, allowing you to chain two actions together and push the limits of how your ship can handle in a dogfight!\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oPYTn7JgqxEsOuJ835WQnw__small/img/y_5FVvxtWBMIUHSzK3xOqps2IVc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4271201.jpg", "complexity": 3.1029, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 2, "playing_time": 45, "categories": ["Aviation / Flight", "Bluffing", "Collectible Components", "Miniatures", "Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Science Fiction", "Wargame"], "mechanics": ["Action Queue", "Critical Hits and Failures", "Dice Rolling", "Line of Sight", "Movement Template", "Player Elimination", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Variable Player Powers"], "types": ["wargames", "cgs"], "bestwith": [2], "recommendedwith": [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 252328}, {"name": "Small World Underground", "yearpublished": 2011, "bayesaverage": 6.88252, "average": 7.22137, "usersrated": 11386, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/97786", "description": "\"This world's not big enough for all of us, so it's time you step aside to make room for me.\"\n\nThat's the spirit of Philippe Keyaerts' award-winning Small World, and the 2011 release Small World Underground is a standalone game that keeps that spirit intact, while putting a new spin on the game play.\n\nSmall World Underground includes 15 fantasy-themed races of creatures along with 21 special powers.

One player, however, will take on the role of The Chisel, whose only goal is to stall and misdirect the detectives at every turn using bluffing, manipulation, and (often) outright lies.\n\nDetective: CoA uses the innovative ARC (Adaptive Response Card) System to create the feel of interrogating a suspect. Suspects do not simply give paragraph-book responses; instead The Chisel carefully chooses how they will answer. When Billy O'Shea insists that the victim was a regular at Topsy's Nightclub, is he telling the truth or is The Chisel subtly leading the detectives toward a dead end that will cost them precious time? Detectives can challenge responses that they think are lies but at great risk: If they're wrong, The Chisel will acquire leverage over them, making the case that much harder to solve.\n\nDetective: CoA includes separate, detailed casebooks for both the detectives and The Chisel. Each crime is a carefully constructed puzzle that can unfold in a variety of ways depending on how the detectives choose to pursue their investigations. As the detectives turn the city upside down, uncovering fresh evidence and \"hot\" leads, hidden suspects may be revealed and new lines of questioning will open up, creating a rich, story-driven experience.\n\nInspired by classic film noir like The Big Sleep, the works of James Ellroy (L.A.

The winner is the player who best balances their position in the race with their success at the side goals.\n\nSetting: Jamaica, 1675.\nAfter a long career in piracy, Captain Henry Morgan skillfully gets appointed to be Governor of Jamaica, with the explicit order to cleanse the Caribbean of pirates and buccaneers! Instead, he invites all of his former \"colleagues\" to join him in his retirement, to enjoy the fruits of their looting with impunity. Each year, in remembrance  of the \"good old days,\" Morgan organizes the Great Challenge, a race around the island, and at its end, the Captain with the most gold is declared Grand Winner.\n\nGoal: The game ends on the turn when at least one player's ship reaches the finish line, completing one circuit around the island of Jamaica. At that point, players are awarded different amounts of gold in accordance with how far away from the finish line they were when the race concluded. This gold is added to any gold a player gathered along the way by detouring from the race to search for valuable treasure, by stealing gold or treasure from other players, or just by loading gold as directed by the cards the player played during the race. The player with the most total gold acquired through all these means is then declared the winner.\n\nGameplay: The game is played in rounds. Each player always has a hand of three cards, and a personal board depicting the five \"holds\" of their ship, into which goods can be loaded during the game. Each round, one player is designated as \"captain,\" with the next clockwise player being captain in the following round, and so on. The captain rolls two standard D6 dice, examines her cards, then announces which die will correspond to the \"day\" and which to the \"night.\" Each player then simultaneously selects a card from their hand and places it face down in front of them. Each card has two symbols on it, one on the left - corresponding to \"day\" - and one on the right (\"night\"). The symbols indicate either ship movement (forward or backward) or the loading of a type of good. After every player has selected a card, all cards are revealed simultaneously and then resolved clockwise one by one, starting with the captain's. When it is a player's turn to resolve her card, for first the left symbol on her card and then for the right symbol, the player will load a number of goods or move a number of spaces equal to the number of pips showing on the corresponding day or night die for that round. Thus the main decision each player makes during the game is which of their current three cards would best serve them on a particular turn, given the values of the day and night dice.  Finally, during the race, when a player lands on a spot already occupied by another player, there is a battle. Battles are mainly resolved by rolling a \"combat\" die, but players may improve their chances by using \"gunpowder\" tokens from their holds, if they loaded any on previous turns. The winner of a battle may steal some goods or treasure from the loser.", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jZRfv3isrBG5waCzEx60Cw__small/img/6q5nirF5yn1d0qtjm2UEI5HV874=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6434838.png", "complexity": 1.6616, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 6, "playing_time": 60, "categories": ["Nautical", "Pirates", "Racing"], "mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Hidden Victory Points", "Race", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Take That", "Track Movement", "Turn Order: Progressive", "Victory Points as a Resource"], "types": ["familygames"], "bestwith": [6], "recommendedwith": [3, 4, 5, 6], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 28023}, {"name": "Space Empires 4X", "yearpublished": 2011, "bayesaverage": 6.87669, "average": 7.70854, "usersrated": 4162, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/84419", "description": "Space Empires is a game in the finest tradition of 4X space games - eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate.

Each player chooses a robot and directs its moves by playing cards. Chaos ensues as all players reveal the cards they've chosen. Players face obstacles like industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyor belts -- but those can also be used to their advantage! Each player aims to make it to each of the checkpoints in numerical order. The first player to reach all of the checkpoints wins. \n\nIn RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.\n\nIn general, players will first fill all of their robot's \"registers\" with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!\n\nRobots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.\n\nThe game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.\n\nUPC 742818050029", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eJx8hRJ6-86C2VrhECwEPA__small/img/J1PlqFqtN-hxuXM4eEi-ekANPP4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1000553.jpg", "complexity": 2.4285, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 8, "playing_time": 120, "categories": ["Maze", "Miniatures", "Racing", "Science Fiction"], "mechanics": ["Action Queue", "Bias", "Grid Movement", "Lose a Turn", "Modular Board", "Programmed Movement", "Race", "Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "types": ["thematic", "strategygames"], "bestwith": [5, 6], "recommendedwith": [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 18}, {"name": "1846: The Race for the Midwest", "yearpublished": 2005, "bayesaverage": 6.8757, "average": 7.87019, "usersrated": 3161, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/17405", "description": "1846 is an 18xx game that traces the westward expansion of railways across the Midwestern United States.\n\nAs in other 18XX games, the winner is the player with the greatest combined wealth (cash on hand + value of stock held + value of private companies owned) at the end of the game.

You can often play companions with events or recurring expenses &ndash; of course you should bring a date to the opera or a horse on your yacht! &ndash; to increase their cost.

Helpers and special cards can provide you with unique powers to further boost your profligacy.\n\nAt the end of each round, you must discard down to two cards in hand, and properties that can depreciate do so; this is good as a player cannot go bankrupt if he owns properties, and the only way to get rid of properties is to sell them, which regretably puts money back in your hands unless the depreciation was intense or you manipulate the market.\n\nIf a player has no money and no properties, he declares bankruptcy and the game ends at the conclusion of that round; otherwise the game ends after seven rounds.

An exciting card driven combat system allows players to modify and upgrade their faction with a wealth of powerful technologies. Players can unleash a Zergling rush, use powerful Protoss shields to halt an enemy invasion, or even send cloaked Ghosts out to guide nuclear missiles to their target.\n\nDescription\n\nIn StarCraft: The Board Game, players battle for galactic domination on a dynamic board of interconnected planets. Planetary setup is already part of the game - every player gets two planets to place, and will place their starting base on one of them. Planets are connected with direct and \"Z-Axis\" connections that are placed during setup, but can sometimes later be modified during the game, and movement is only possible within planets and through those connections (by means of purpose-built transports).\n\nEach player controls a faction out of six, that belongs to one race out of three - Humans, Zerg, and Protoss. Each faction has a unique special victory condition, but all factions can also win through victory points that are gained by controlling special areas on some of the planets. Players build units and base upgrades with the resources they gather from the planetary areas that they control, and gain access to additional unit types through those upgrades.\n\nEach turn is subdivided into first a planning phase, then an execution phase, and finally a regrouping phase (used for cleanup). In the planning phase, players take turns playing a number of order tokens into stacks on each planet, with orders placed later obstructing the ones that were placed before them. This allows players to set up combos of their own, but also to obstruct plans of other players. In the execution phase then, players take turns again, and when a player's turn comes up he can choose one of his order tokens on top of any stack and execute that one - if all of their orders are obstructed, they skip their action and draw an event card instead. The execution phase isn't over until all players executed all of their orders. Possible orders are Build (used for building both units and buildings), Mobilize (used for moving units and attacking enemies) and Research (see below), and orders can always be Standard Orders or Special Orders, with the special orders having prerequisites but stronger effects.\n\nPlayers can also research new technologies and thus improve their combat deck in a precursor to more recent deck building mechanisms.

Gameplay is driven by the innovative cascading production system.

Statues are key to scoring, and you'll spend carts to move them through the tunnels to prime scoring locations near the heart of the mountain.\n\nA major aspect of the game is the cascading production. You begin with a line of four trolls, and every troll shows the combination of resources &mdash; gold, stone, iron, marble, carts, runes, and hammers &mdash; that it produces. When a new troll is hired, place it above two other trolls, forming a \"pyramid\". The new troll activates, gaining its resources, and any trolls beneath it ALSO activate, gaining any resources that they have room to carry. In this way as you hire more trolls, you gain bigger and bigger windfalls of resources as the end of the game nears.

Madeira, the Portuguese word for wood, refers to the dense forest that covered its wild, fertile landscape. This, and its strategic position far into the Atlantic Ocean made the island one of the most significant Portuguese discoveries. Madeira served as a &ldquo;laboratory&rdquo; for what would become the Portuguese Empire.\n\nWheat plantations were the first means for survival on the island. After that, when D. Henrique decided to increase the economy of the Empire, sugar became the core business of Madeira. Once sugar started coming from other places in the world, such as Africa and Brazil, profits from sugar were no longer enough, and production of the very famous Madeira wine became the most important economic product of the island.\n\nPlayers try to adapt themselves to these constraints, working to find better fields for farming the right goods and for obtaining precious wood, essential for erecting new structures in the cities and for building ships. In turn, the ships are crucial for trading in foreign markets, as well as for taking part in new expeditions to discover other countries.\nMadeira has been established just as it was in the original administrative division of the island under 3 captaincies (Funchal, Machico, and Porto Santo), where the ultimate goal is to develop the Island, gaining the most prestige under and for the Portuguese Crown.\n\nThe Crown of Portugal has a series of requests regarding expeditions, urbanization, opening trade routes, increasing wealth, and controlling the guilds on the islands. Three times during the game, the players gain prestige for fulfilling certain requests by the Crown. At two other times, the Crown requests that the islands change the focus of their agriculture due to the changes in the world.\n\nPlayers must carefully choose the correct timing to show their achievements. Too early and you don&rsquo;t gain as much prestige, too late and you risk someone else stealing the best opportunities.

Football had become the predominant national pastime &mdash; that is until the year 2032, the year baseball decided to revolutionize the game and regain the throne!\n\nStarting in 2032, baseball games were shortened to six innings. Pitchers were encouraged to have bionic arm implants to improve their pitching. These cyborgs, or 'Borgs as they're affectionately known, were immediately popular and soon ruled the league. In 2041, robotic players were introduced to get more offense back into the game. These robots were similar to designated hitters in that they were used only to bat and did not field. However, recent reports indicate fielding 'Bots are on the way.\n\nNow in 2045, human players are still in the game and known as Naturals. They are the best fielders by far but are sorely challenged when it comes to hitting and pitching. Some Naturals have learned to hit by swinging before the pitcher starts his windup, which gives them a chance to hit the ball. Although it's hard for a Natural to get into the league, those who do are popular. Many Naturals have named themselves after the great players of pre-2032 baseball by taking a first and last name borrowed from different star players of the past. The fans love them, and their presence on the team ensures good revenue!\n\nThe stage is now set! The fans are energized and root fanatically for their new favorites, be they 'Bots, 'Borgs or Naturals!\n\nBaseball Highlights: 2045 is like watching TV&nbsp;highlights of early 21st-century baseball games, with the gameplay being full of theme with no outs or innings and without bogging down in a play-by-play baseball simulation. In this quick and interactive game, two players build their teams as they play, combining both strategy (building your team) and tactics (playing the game) without any of the downtime. During each \"mini-game\", each player alternates playing six cards to simulate a full game's highlights.

A new action allows players to add delegates to different parties, the first delegate each generation being free, and additional ones costing 5 MC. Neutral delegates are added by the global events, representing the wishes and trends of society.\nWhen a player (even the neutral player) has more delegates in a party than any other player, that player takes over the party leader seat for that party, and when a party has more delegates than any other party, it becomes dominant.

Influence is gained from being the chairman of the Committee, being party leader in the dominant party, and for having a non-leader delegate in the dominant party.\nIn order to pay for all these new bonuses, the Committee is revising the terraform rating, lowering it for all players by 1 step each generation.\n\nIn Turmoil, players can try to force their own agenda, or push it in a more moderate, economic way. They can play to mitigate the global events with influence, or adjust their play to better take advantage of them.

Player One chooses Moon Elf and player two picks Barbarian. Each player begins the game with 50 HP (Health Points).\n\nPlayer One (the Moon Elf) won the roll to go first.

This is where the Moon Elf player can upgrade their hero board with cards from their hands if they have enough CP to pay for the upgrades. They can also play any Main Phase Action cards (blue cards).\n\nThen they enter the Offensive Roll Phase. The Moon Elf can take up to 3 roll attempts (with their 5 dice) to accomplish an action or attack from their hero board. After deciding on an action within the 3 roll attempts an action is declared.\n\nThen the Defensive Roll Phase begins where the opponent (Barbarian) can use their defensive roll (as it appears on their hero board). The amount of damage or incoming status affects are resolved and that concludes the Defensive Roll Phase.\n\n\n     During Offensive and Defensive Roll Phase any player can play Roll Phase Action cards from their hand as long as they have the CP to pay for it.\n\n\nThe Moon Elf player enters their second Main Phase where they can do any final hero board upgrades or play blue Main Phase Action cards.\n\nThe Moon Elf then must discard any extra cards over 6 from their hand.\n\nThe Barbarian player begins his turn by drawing one additional card (over his starting hand of 4) and gaining one CP (Combat Point) for a total of 2.\n\nThe Barbarian then follows the same phases the Moon Elf.\n\nThe game alternates hero turns until one player is at 0 Health.\n\nDiceThrone is for 2-6 players, ages 8+, and runs 20-30 minutes for a battle.

One player acts as game master, revealing the maze-like dungeon piecemeal as the players wander.  Up to four other players take on a character (wizard, elf, dwarf, or barbarian) and venture forth into dungeons on fantasy quests. This game was made in cooperation with Games Workshop Ltd. who designed the miniatures and helped in many of the production details including background world and art in the rule book and scenario book. The HeroQuest series consists of the main game and a number of expansions.\n\nThe game is played on a grid representing the interior of a dungeon or castle, with walls segmenting the grid into rooms and corridors. One player assumes the role of the evil wizard character (Zargon/Morcar), and uses a map taken from the game's quest book to determine how the quest is to be played. The map details the placement of monsters, artifacts, and doors, as well as the overall quest the other players are embarking upon. During a Hero's turn, the player can move before or after performing one of the following actions: attack, cast a spell, search for traps and secret doors, search for treasure.\n\nThe game ends when every player has either returned to the spiral staircase, exited by a door, or been killed by the evil wizard. If the objective of the quest has not been accomplished then the evil wizard character wins. Items collected during the quest may be kept for future quests. The quests usually form part of a longer story, especially the quests which are part of the expansion packs.\n\nAdditional material, which is generally missed since it is not technically an expansion, was published in the HeroQuest: Adventure Design Kit which did feature one more Heroquest adventure: A Plague of Zombies.", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/v695lqCTLA_PU6fBHmfXCA__small/img/aX66kuy84pnBa8Sxlwn8Hcqq2yo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5676212.jpg", "complexity": 2.1338, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 5, "playing_time": 90, "categories": ["Adventure", "Exploration", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Miniatures"], "mechanics": ["Cooperative Game", "Dice Rolling", "Die Icon Resolution", "Grid Movement", "Modular Board", "Role Playing", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game", "Square Grid", "Team-Based Game", "Variable Player Powers"], "types": ["thematic"], "bestwith": [5], "recommendedwith": [2, 3, 4, 5], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 699}, {"name": "Tobago", "yearpublished": 2009, "bayesaverage": 6.83657, "average": 7.09602, "usersrated": 12645, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/42215", "description": "Tobago is an adventure game in which the players use representations of treasure maps to locate unknown treasures.

The more clues you have provided, the more of a stake you will have in the loot.\nPlayers can carefully play their clues and use bonus-action gems to influence where and when the treasure is found in order to ensure a more favourable outcome when the loot is finally 'dug up' and shared.\n\nThe game features a 3 piece, double-sided, modular game board which can be rearranged to create 32 possible island arrangements.", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fuC2C10_6QK84R45Mseojw__small/img/bfp4x8H9nzQJQyNf2amKyx1BqUs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic596625.jpg", "complexity": 2.1331, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 4, "playing_time": 60, "categories": ["Adventure", "Deduction", "Exploration"], "mechanics": ["Deduction", "Grid Movement", "Hand Management", "Hexagon Grid", "Modular Board", "Push Your Luck", "Variable Set-up"], "types": ["familygames"], "bestwith": [4], "recommendedwith": [2, 3, 4], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 42215}, {"name": "Triumph & Tragedy: European Balance of Power 1936-1945", "yearpublished": 2015, "bayesaverage": 6.8359, "average": 8.13777, "usersrated": 2524, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/130960", "description": "Triumph & Tragedy is a geopolitical strategy game for 3  players (also playable by 2) covering the competition for European supremacy during the period 1936-45 between Capitalism (the West), Communism (the Soviet  Union) and Fascism (the Axis). It has diplomatic, economic, technological and military components, and can be won by gaining economic hegemony or  technological supremacy (A-bomb), or by vanquishing a rival militarily.\n\nThe 22 x 34 area map covers Eurasia to India and the Urals, plus the Americas. Military units are 5/8\" blocks, of 7 types   (Infantry/Tank/Fortress/AirForce/Carrier/Fleet/Submarine), in 7 different colors (Germany/Italy/Russia/Britain/France/USA/Neutral). The mix of over 200 blocks allows great flexibility of force composition. There is a 55-card Action deck and a 55-card Investment deck, plus 30 Peace Dividend chits and 110 markers of various types.\n\nThe  game starts in 1936, with all 3 Great Powers virtually disarmed: Germany has repudiated the Versailles Peace Treaty, initiating an arms race in Europe. With blocks, the nature of military buildups remain unknown to rivals unless/until military conflict breaks out. The  game may end peacefully or there may be war. There are game sanctions for attacking neutral minors or declaring war on an opponent, and rewards for remaining peaceful (you get a Peace Dividend chit of value 0-2 for every year you remain at Peace).\n\nYou can win peacefully by:  \n&bull; Economic Hegemony (total of Production + secret Peace Dividend values + Atomic Research is the greatest in 1945, or reaches 25 at any time) OR \n&bull; Technological Supremacy (build the A-bomb which takes 4 stages and be able to deliver it to a Main Capital).\n\nIf there is war, you can still win by either of the above methods (with extra Economic Hegemony victory points available), or by:\n&bull; Military Victory (capture TWO enemy capitals out of nine: each player controls three).\n\nEconomic production underlies all forms of power in the game. Production is the LEAST of controlled Population (cities), controlled Resources, and Industry (which starts low and can be built up with Investment cards), except that Resources can be ignored if at Peace.\n\nPowers can spend their current economic Production on either: \n&bull; Military units (new 1-step units or additional steps on existing units), OR \n&bull; Action cards, which have Diplomatic values (to gain Population and Resources without conflict) and a Command value (to move military units), OR \n&bull; Investment cards, which have Technological values (to enhance unit abilities) and a Factory value (the only way to increase Industry levels).\n\nBuilding a unit step or buying a card costs 1 Production. Simple. You can&rsquo;t inspect cards bought until after you have spent all Production.\n\nInitially, the Axis economy is Population/Resource limited, but ahead in [war] Industry, while the West and Russia are Industry-limited, with adequate empires of Population and Resources. Throttling/limiting rival economies by denial of Population/Resources is a key form of competition. In peacetime, this is primarily done via Diplomacy, committing Action cards to gain control of minor nations and their Population/Resources, or to deny or reduce Rival control of them. At war, this can be done more directly by military conquest on land, by Naval/Submarine blockade of trade routes at sea, and by Strategic Bombing of enemy Industry by air forces.\n The early phase of the game tends to revolve around: \n&bull; Diplomatic  infighting (using Action cards), to gain minor nations (Czech, Rumania, etc) for their Population and Resources, and \n&bull; Industrial buildup (via  Investment cards), with\n&bull; Military buildups (with the nature of forces being built being unknown to opponents),\n&bull; Technology  advancement (also via Investment cards), and some\n&bull; Military operations (using Action cards for Command), which can include Violating (attacking) neutral minors to gain Population/Resources when Diplomacy fails.\n\nIf  the game continues peacefully due to imposing defenses or player inclination, pressure builds as players approach a Production of 20, as secret Peace Dividend chits may take someone over the 25 Victory threshold. Or players may succeed in developing the Atomic Bomb and steal a victory that way.\n\nAt  some point, however, one Power (seeing opportunity or necessity) may Declare War on another. The victim gets immediate economic benefits in reaction, but military reality comes to the forefront from this point onward. The third party may well continue its economic development in peace. Or not.\n\nUnit movement is by Command card, which specifies a Command Priority letter that determines order of movement/combat and a Command Value number that  determines the maximum number of units that can be moved. Command cards are only valid during one specified Season (Spring/Summer/Fall), so a variety of Command cards in one&rsquo;s hand is necessary for a Power to be able to move in every Season. But HandSizes are limited, so each player must balance competing demands for card resources with military security.\n\nCombat occurs when rival units occupy the same area, and is executed by units firing in order by Type (defenders firing first amongst equal types), rolling dice for hits. Units have different Firepowers (hit values) depending on the Class of unit they are  targeting (ground, naval, air, sub). Land combat is one round per Season while sea battles are fought to a conclusion. Ground units without a Supply line lose 1 step per Season and cannot build (except Fortress units which are immune to both effects but cannot move).\n\nTriumph & Tragedy is a true three-sided game: there is no requirement that the West and Russia be on the same side (and in fact there are valid reasons to attack each other), and only ONE player can win the game. Table talk is allowed (and encouraged) but agreements are not enforceable. Alliances are shifting and co-operation is undependable. The game can continue as an economic battle of attrition or a sudden military explosion can change everything. There is immense replayability as players can pursue dominance in Europe via land, sea or air military superiority, technological supremacy, or economic hegemony without rivals realizing their strategy until it is TOO LATE! It is a highly interactive, tense, fast-moving game with little downtime between player turns, covering THE crucial geopolitical decade of the 20th century in 4-6 hours.", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KuJMYH3VVj3BriDYaYvDQw__small/img/79snZF_WwHakF2PPbOhXFLqjYLc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2497742.jpg", "complexity": 3.4211, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 3, "playing_time": 360, "categories": ["Economic", "Negotiation", "Political", "Territory Building", "Wargame", "World War II"], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Area Movement", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Movement Points", "Secret Unit Deployment"], "types": ["wargames"], "bestwith": [3], "recommendedwith": [3], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 130960}, {"name": "Spirit Island: Feather & Flame", "yearpublished": 2022, "bayesaverage": 6.83488, "average": 9.001, "usersrated": 1545, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/356510", "description": "Contains:\n\n     Promo Pack 1\n     Promo Pack 2\n\n\nWith the onset of the dangerous invaders, blighting the lands with their harmful practices and aggression, we spirits have had to grow and change in ways unanticipated.

With these few materials, players work to develop their civilization. The emphasis in the game is logistical transport as you bring goods to producers to make new goods. But beware, the only thing you own is what is on your transporters, and anyone can use any production facility, or pick up any goods left behind.\n\nIn more detail, this massive set of pieces looks more like a modular game kit than anything else. You get a several small hexes in a number of colors for terrain type; hundreds of little counters for the commodities that are produced and the locations where they're produced; wooden disks for all of the donkeys, rafts, trucks, and other forms of transportation you can use; and a roll of acrylic with an erasable marker. The tiles are laid out in whatever scenario you wish to play, and then the clear plastic is taped over the top to secure the entire board. Roads and bridges are drawn on the plastic and chits are placed in the hexes to form the playing surface. The idea is that your transportation units (at first, a fleet of 3 donkeys) travel about and pick items that part produced. However, the only thing that you own is that which is carried by your transports. So you might have a nice, shiny, new truck factory or a gold-filled mine, but anyone can use it or take it, if they collect the necessary components and can transport them to the factory.

One day, the little rat children discovered a comic in the junkyard that described the first landing on the moon, and thus the plan was born: Build a rocket and take over the cheese moon!\n\nFortunately, the junkyard has everything the rats need to build their rocket, and the other animals are willing to support this daring venture &mdash; at least if they're well paid. Of course, all the rats work together to achieve this mighty goal. However, each rat family competes to build the most rocket parts and to train the most rattronauts so they can feast on as much of the lunar cheese as possible.\n\nIn First Rat, each player starts with two rats and may raise two more. On your turn, you either move one of your rats 1-5 spaces on the path or move 2-4 of your rats 1-3 spaces each as long as they end up on spaces of the same color. Your rats can never share the same space, and if you land in a space with another player's rat, you must pay them one cheese, borrowing cheese from the back as needed. After movement, you collect resources (cheese, tin cans, apple cores, baking soda, etc.) matching the color of the space you occupy or move your lightbulb along the light string, which will boost your income in future turns. (More lights in the junkyard makes it easier for you to find things!)\n\nIf you end movement near a store, you can spend resources to buy a backpack or bottle top &mdash; or you can steal an item instead, with the rat then returning to the start of the movement track. You can also spend resources to build rocket sections (and score points) or spend cheese in bulk as a donation (and score points).\n\nWhen you pick up apple cores, you move around the rat burrow to pick up comics or stored food or raise one of your rats from the nursery. Alternatively, you automatically get a new rat when one of your rats reaches the launch pad and boards the spaceship. When a player places their fourth rat on the spaceship &mdash; or places their eighth scoring marker on the board &mdash; the game ends, and the player with the most points wins.

The gameboard features 109 spaces, with one card in the deck for each of those spaces.\n\nAt the start of a round, each player receives a hand of five cards.

When you play a bonus card, you might trigger another bonus card... and then another!\n\nAdditionally, there are five different ways to score substantial bonus points for the areas, e.g., in the Residences you need to place tokens on houses of four different values, and in the Townspeople area you need to place tokens on all three types in a pyramid. You can only score each area's bonus once, and importantly each time a bonus is claimed then the value available for later players is reduced.\n\nWhen someone has placed their final diamond token or when you can't deal a new hand of five cards to each player, then the game ends and the player with the most successful glass dynasty (most points) is declared the winner.", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/acERQjU6qQ_BGxF3IBri8w__small/img/AHl1ONikJsG3ZqNfow6E_nT0bh0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6703416.jpg", "complexity": 2.1679, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 4, "playing_time": 90, "categories": ["Card Game", "Industry / Manufacturing"], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Closed Drafting", "Pattern Building"], "types": ["strategygames", "familygames"], "bestwith": [4], "recommendedwith": [3, 4], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 346501}, {"name": "Cuba Libre", "yearpublished": 2013, "bayesaverage": 6.82264, "average": 7.65745, "usersrated": 3780, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/111799", "description": "In December 1956, paroled rebel Fidel Castro returned to Cuba to launch his revolution with virtually no political base and&mdash;after a disastrous initial encounter with government forces&mdash;a total of just 12 men.

Meanwhile, anti-communist student groups, urban guerrillas, and expatriates try to de-stabilize the Batista regime from inside and out, while trying not to pave the way for a new dictatorship under Castro.

Three Sisters is named after an indigenous agricultural technique still widely used today in which three different crops &mdash; pumpkins, corn, and beans &mdash; are planted close together. Corn provides a lattice for beans to climb, the beans bring nitrogen from the air into the soil, and the squash provides a natural mulch ground cover to reduce weeds and keep pests away.\n\nIn the game, you have your own player sheet with multiple areas: the garden, which is divided into six numbered zones, each containing the three crop types; the apiary; compost; perennials; goods; fruit; and the shed, which is filled with tools that have special abilities. All the crops, fruits, flowers, and hives are represented by tracks that you will mark off as you acquire these items. Many of the tracks are interconnected with other elements in the game, giving you bonuses along the way. A common feature of these tracks are circles that represent a harvest, which generates goods; get enough goods, and you unlock bonus actions. Advancing on all of these tracks offers various amounts of points, advancements, and bonuses.\n\nThe game lasts eight rounds. Each round, roll dice based on the number of players, group them by number, then place them on an action space of the circular action wheel, starting with the current position of the farmer; the farmer moves each round, which means that dice showing 1s, 2s, etc. will end up on different spaces each round. Once the dice have been placed, each player drafts one die and uses it as described below. Once everyone has drafted a die, all players get to use the lowest-valued die remaining on the action wheel. A die lets you do two things, which you can do in either order:\n\n\n     Plant or water the numbered zone matching the value of the die.\n     Take the action of the space from which you removed the die.\n\n\nTo plant, you mark the bottom space of two empty crop tracks. (Note that you can't plant beans until the corn adjacent to the beans is tall enough to support them.) To water, you mark one space in all the crop tracks that already have at least one mark in them. As for the actions on the action wheel, you can:\n\n\n     Plant or water again in the same numbered zone.\n     Gain one compost (which lets you adjust die values) and four goods (which will get you bonuses at the farmer's market).\n     Mark off the hive track, which can bring you points, goods, or bonus actions.\n     Mark one of the four fruit tracks. Each fruit is worth different points and different amounts of goods and has different track lengths and circle positions.\n     Visit the farmer's market, which gives you points and bonuses based on the number of goods you've collected.\n     Mark one of the fifteen tool tracks in your shed. As soon as you complete a track, you gain that power or end-game scoring opportunity.\n\n\nPerennials don't have a direct action associated with them and are marked off only through actions in other areas, with the various perennials giving different bonuses as you mark them.\n\nAt the end of the round, all players receive a bonus action, either rain that waters all numbered zones in your garden, a trip to the shed, or a visit to the farmer's market. After eight rounds, you score points for harvested crops, perennials, the apiary, fruit, and some shed items. Whoever has the most points wins.\n\nThree Sisters has a solo mode in which you try to top your own score against an \"opponent\" that drafts dice and blocks areas of your sheet.", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Z1ihG_FHEKuf1Et53f2Dzg__small/img/3LXpXcuoBQGQACl-Yw4fGqls2GM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6349029.png", "complexity": 2.6311, "min_players": 1, "max_players": 4, "playing_time": 60, "categories": ["Dice", "Farming"], "mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Paper-and-Pencil", "Rondel", "Solo / Solitaire Game"], "types": ["strategygames"], "bestwith": [2, 3], "recommendedwith": [1, 2, 3, 4], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 291845}, {"name": "Alhambra: Big Box", "yearpublished": 2009, "bayesaverage": 6.82101, "average": 7.48297, "usersrated": 4763, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/45358", "description": "One big box containing the Alhambra base game plus all five of its current expansions.

In the game, players take on the role of rabbis who create and grow these powerful creatures that will be moved around the neighborhoods of Prague under the control of students. Be careful, because if a golem becomes too powerful, it will destroy everything it encounters on its way. Players can also kill their Golems in order to get bonuses.\n\nPlayers also create powerful artifacts and acquire knowledge by collecting ancient books.\n\nThe game is divided into four rounds, and each round is composed of 7 phases:\n\n\n     Refresh\n     Golem Movement\n     Actions (2 marble actions and 1 rabbi action)\n     Turn Order\n     Influence Character\n     Income and Development\n     Golem Control\n\n\nAt the beginning of each round, the players will shuffle the colored marbles into the 3D synagogue that will split them into five lines corresponding to the five main actions available in the game:\n\n\n     Work: By paying Knowledge, you can activate the Golem placed in the city of Prague and get bonuses.\n     Golem: Obtain clay to create new golems and upgrade the developments on your personal board.\n     Artifact: Obtain coins and buy gold to build artifacts that offer permanent bonuses in the game and upgrade developments on your personal board.\n     Spells: Obtain Knowledge and perform spells (with a scoring for book collection) and upgrade developments on your personal board.\n     Mirror: Perform one action of your choice by paying 1 coin.\n\n\nThe number of marbles available in the corresponding action line determines how much the player gets from the action. When you choose an action, you collect one marble of your choice in the corresponding line and depending on the color of the marble you chose, you also move your student forward on one of the districts of Prague.\n\nIt's important to advance your students on those tracks to be able to keep your golems under control. At the end of the round, knowledge can also be used to control a golem that surpassed its students, but if one of these creatures is uncontrolled, it may become dangerous and destroy the neighborhood, after which you will have to destroy and bury it!\n\nThe marble color also matters, because at the end of the round, if you get the correct combination of two colors, you receive the favor of one of the powerful Prague characters, which will differ each round.\n\nAt the end of the fourth round, players score points for active or buried golems, artifacts, books, development on their personal board, and collected goal cards.", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9wDd5YVER3lwpGO3v5EkTA__small/img/81chTLWy3JxqRTktAuE4Nb4LamI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5374175.jpg", "complexity": 4.016, "min_players": 1, "max_players": 4, "playing_time": 120, "categories": ["Fantasy", "Novel-based", "Renaissance"], "mechanics": ["Action Drafting", "Income", "Set Collection", "Variable Player Powers", "Variable Set-up", "Worker Placement"], "types": ["strategygames"], "bestwith": [2, 3], "recommendedwith": [1, 2, 3, 4], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 298383}, {"name": "Struggle of Empires", "yearpublished": 2004, "bayesaverage": 6.81406, "average": 7.5297, "usersrated": 4393, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9625", "description": "Struggle of Empires recreates the various wars fought between the European powers as they attempted to become the dominant force in Europe and the rest of the world during the eighteenth century.

They&rsquo;ll combine forces and work cooperatively to accomplish their goals, and against all odds, stay alive.

But the creatures they will face are not just zombie humans, they&rsquo;re zombie orcs! The Survivors will have to gear up with a wide variety of medieval equipment if they hope to outlast these fearsome foes. Zombie Orcs are stronger than the classic zombie and represent a stiffer challenge to even seasoned undead-hunting veterans.\n\nA new challenge for the Survivors is the Horde. It represents a growing group of Orc zombies that are ready to enter the board in an unexpected location and ambush the Survivors. As zombie cards with the Horde symbol are drawn, one extra zombie miniature of the same type is set aside, collectively forming the Horde. They will be locked into place until an &ldquo;Enter the Horde!&rdquo; card is drawn, spawning the Horde on the board. Any Survivor caught on their own near this roving menace would best beat a hasty retreat.\n\nWith such menacing new foes, the Survivors are going to have their hands full dealing with the Green Horde. Luckily, they&rsquo;ll have some new weapons and spells on their side to help combat the rotting masses.

Oh, and if they should gather together too tightly, the Survivors can always hit them with the catapult...(did we not mention the catapult?).\n\nZombicide: Green Horde includes ten new challenging quests, featuring some of the toughest scenarios a Survivor has ever had to face.

Players are archaeologists who must travel around Europe, northern Africa, and the Middle East to acquire knowledge about five ancient civilizations -- the Greeks, the Cretans, the Egyptians, the Palestinians, and the Mesopotamians -- and then must use this knowledge to excavate historical sites in the areas of these civilizations. Through the course of the game, expositions are revealed, and an archaeologist who has treasures from the requisite civilizations may claim the prize (this is a change from the first edition's handling of exhibitions). The archaeologist who learns the most about the civilizations, claims the greatest-valued artifacts, and collects the most exhibitions will win out over his or her colleagues.\n\nThe key element to the game is that it is played out over a period of two (or three) years, and each action a player performs takes a certain amount of time -- traveling is a week between cities, gathering knowledge takes time for the level of the knowledge, and actually digging at a cultural site takes time to yield a certain number of artifact tiles. The game uses a novel mechanism to keep track of this. There is a track of 52 spaces around the outside of the board. Each time a player moves and takes an action, he or she moves their player token forward in time. Players take turns based on being the one who is furthest back in \"time\". So, a player can go to an excavation site and spend 10 weeks digging for artifacts, but that will also mean that the other players will likely be taking several actions in the interim while that player waits for the \"time\" to catch up.\n\nIn addition, the artifact tiles for each civilization are drawn from a bag that also contains dirt.  When a player excavates a site, that player pulls tiles from the bag, but some may only be worthless dirt instead of valuable treasure. That dirt is then returned to the bag, making the first draw more likely to provide useful tiles.\n\nThis is the new entry for the Queen printing of Jenseits von Theben.

Ares Games plans to expand the Battles game system in the future, releasing expansions depicting other battles from the Third Age of Middle-earth narrated in The Lord of the Rings, such as the Siege of Gondor and the assault of Saruman against Rohan.", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SQBx844N1Ay31pm368Ckkg__small/img/j5q6CR72Lqv4mkA-G1KKTBa9rYU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1886964.jpg", "complexity": 3.5912, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 2, "playing_time": 240, "categories": ["Adventure", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Novel-based", "Wargame"], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Area Movement", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management"], "types": ["wargames", "thematic"], "bestwith": [2], "recommendedwith": [2], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 135219}, {"name": "Formula D", "yearpublished": 2008, "bayesaverage": 6.79593, "average": 6.99227, "usersrated": 20275, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/37904", "description": "Formula D is a high stakes Formula One type racing game where the players race simulated cars with the hope of crossing the finish line first.  This is a re-release of Formula D\u00e9 with several changes from the original format. Whilst old tracks can be used with the updated Formula D rules, the new game features boards that have an F1 track and a Street Track on the other side. These street tracks each have a novel inclusion or two to add greater theme -\n\nThe game mechanisms are a simple race, get to the finish line first!  However, players have to use a significant amount of planning, and rely on quite a bit of luck.  Each player manages when to shift gears, with each gear providing a different speed.  (For example, 4th gear is a die that rolls random numbers from 7 to 12 for spaces moved.)  Each turn, players may move up one gear, stay in that gear, or move down gears.  This forces players to match possible rolls with the optimum distance for that turn, and hopefully plan ahead.  However, speed is not the only issue!  Corners have a \"stop\" rule that requires players to stop once, twice, or three times on that corner in consecutive turns or face a penalty.  This creates an effective speed limit to the corners. \n Of course, things do not always go as planned!  Players take penalties if they miss their roll, bump into another car, are blocked by other cars, have to brake heavily, or have to downshift several gears.  These are taken off of a car&rsquo;s attributes (Tire health, Brake wear, Transmission Gears, Body, engine, and Suspension).  Losing the maximum in any of these categories will result in elimination, or a severe setback for that car.  This requires that players manage their car&rsquo;s health, plan for their best path, and have good luck on their rolls.  This high amount of luck gives the game its family appeal, and lets weaker players have a chance at winning once in a while.\n\nHowever, the fun does not end with a single race!  The rules include the ability to customize your cars, use a pre-generated character, add Slipstreaming (Drafting) rules and road debris, and change tire types to modify your distance rolls.  There are also variations for a single lap race, or multiple laps with pit stops to repair some of your damage points.  In addition, numerous expansion tracks can be purchased to vary the demands on each driver and car.  Each track may also have weather effects (rain) that change car handling and die rolls due to skidding on wet track.  This opens up the game for rally rules giving championship points over a number of races.\n\nFormula D adds a few items that are not in the original Formula De:  There is the added excitement of illegal racing in the streets of big cities - anything goes!  This adds custom cars, nitro acceleration, drifting in the curves, dirty tricks, gun battles, and trash on the road to add more variation.  A basic change is the use of a \"Dashboard\" with movable pegs to manage your car&rsquo;s attributes instead of the paper forms from Formula De.  There are also two sets of pre-painted cars; a Formula 1 set and the Street Race set of stock cars.  The street cars come with \"Character\" profiles to give a bit of role-playing to the game.  Finally, the old category of \"Fuel\" for the car has been renamed Transmission Wear to give a better thematic fit to the effect of multiple downshifting.\n\nThe popularity of this game has given it a lot of expansions, some simplifications to the rules (See Formula D\u00e9 Mini), and a lot of \"after market\" parts.  There are also fan expansions and tracks for the very dedicated player.  In many ways, this has become a multiple game system.", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ScuaQBHRYnsqrwSxSdEdIw__small/img/F7CaSsa_MWIbHGCoeZ98apbmFQM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic519914.jpg", "complexity": 1.9674, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 10, "playing_time": 60, "categories": ["Racing", "Sports"], "mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Different Dice Movement", "Grid Movement", "Movement Points", "Player Elimination", "Push Your Luck", "Race", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Simulation", "Turn Order: Stat-Based"], "types": ["thematic", "familygames"], "bestwith": [5, 6, 7, 8], "recommendedwith": [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 37904}, {"name": "Azul: Master Chocolatier", "yearpublished": 2022, "bayesaverage": 6.79512, "average": 7.86975, "usersrated": 3059, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/363247", "description": "In the game Azul, players take turns drafting colored tiles from suppliers to their player board.

One player is the Overlord, playing the opposition forces, and the other players  play Conan and his companions: Shevatas the thief, Hadrathus the Priest/Sorcerer, Belit the pirate queen, Valeria the warrior, etc. The game is based purely on Robert E. Howard's novels and short stories.\n\nEach game is a scenario, played on a map. There are 4 maps included in the retail copy of the game, and each map can have several scenarios set on it. The game is fast, one hour approximately. It's possible to play several scenarios in a campaign, but you can also play each scenario individually. There are 9 scenarios in the base box.\n\nAt the beginning of a scenario, players choose their team (Conan and two or three other heroes). The Overlord gathers all the miniatures (picts, Necromancer, skeleton warriors, monsters, etc.), tokens, and cards from the chosen scenario. The game usually plays in a limited number of turns (ten, for instance). Each scenario can have very different objectives.\n\nDuring their turn, the heroes can activate or rest. If they activate, they can spend \"gems\" from their energy pool to do all sorts of actions: move, fight (melee or distance), defend, pick a lock, reroll, etc. If they rest, they can move a lot of gems from their \"spent\" pool box to their \"available\" pool box.  The Overlord plays differently. He uses a board with eight slidable tiles, plus his own Energy gems. Each tile corresponds to one unit (1 to 3 miniatures) on the game mat, and all of the miniature abilities are written on this tile (movement, armor, attack, special abilities). The tile position on the board corresponds to the numbers 1-8. The Overlord has a pool of energy gems and each time he activates one unit, he needs to spend a number of gems matching the tile placement.\n\nIn a typical scenario, the heroes need to accomplish something and the Overlord wins if the heroes fail to reach their objective &mdash; but in some scenarios, the Overlord has his own objectives and the Heroes win if they prevent him from accomplishing his goal.", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x0VJACjymxo4boRichVVKQ__small/img/RmO8s9A4mxFlU37HD-8h4IhQN8U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3118623.jpg", "complexity": 2.7698, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 5, "playing_time": 90, "categories": ["Adventure", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Miniatures", "Novel-based"], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Area Movement", "Dice Rolling", "Player Elimination", "Team-Based Game", "Variable Phase Order", "Variable Player Powers"], "types": ["thematic"], "bestwith": [4], "recommendedwith": [2, 3, 4, 5], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 160010}, {"name": "The Downfall of Pompeii", "yearpublished": 2004, "bayesaverage": 6.79481, "average": 7.16279, "usersrated": 8650, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/13004", "description": "The year is AD 79.

Before the eruption, players play cards to place their pieces in buildings. After the first eruption, they can also place as many relatives as the number of pieces already in the building they placed their piece in. When Omen cards are drawn, the player can take any opponent's piece and throw it into the erupting volcano. In this manner, players try to get as many pieces onto the board as close to the exits from the city as possible.\n\nAfter the second eruption, the game changes. Now each player places a lava tile, which kills any pieces on that square and may block exits from the city. Then they move two pieces toward the exits, moving them a number of squares equal to the pieces on the square from which they started.

A dauntless explorer? Command your armada, construct world-shattering technologies, and rally the remnants of humanity for a final confrontation.\n\nIn Quantum, each player is a fleet commander from one of the four factions of humanity, struggling to conquer a sector of space. Every die is a starship, with the value of the die determining the movement of the ship, but also its combat power - with low numbers more powerful. So a [ 6 ] is a quick but fragile Scout and a [ 1 ] is a slow but mighty Battlestation.\n\nEach type of ship also has a special power that can be used once per turn: Destroyers can warp space to swap places with other dice and Flagships can transport other ships. These powers can be used in combination for devastating effects. You're not stuck with your starting ships, however: using Quantum technology, you can spend actions to transform (re-roll) your ships. Randomness plays a role in the game, but only when you want: Quantum is very much a strategy game.\n\nYou win by constructing Quantum Cubes - massive planetary energy extractors.

With massive warming altering the globe, another titanic struggle for supremacy has unwittingly commenced between the varying animal species.\n\nDominant Species: Marine is a game that abstractly recreates a small portion of ancient history: the ending of an onerous ice age and what that entails for the living creatures trying to adapt to the slowly-changing earth.\n\nEach player will assume the role of one of four major aquatic-based animal classes &mdash; reptiles, fish, cephalopod or crustacean. Each begins the game more or less in a state of natural balance in relation to one another. But that won&rsquo;t last: It is indeed &ldquo;survival of the fittest.&rdquo;\n\nThrough wily action pawn placement, you will attempt to thrive in as many different habitats as possible in order to claim powerful card effects. You will also want to propagate your individual species in order to earn victory points for your animal. You will be aided in these endeavors via speciation, migration and adaptation actions, among others.\n\nAll of this eventually leads to the end game &ndash; the final ascent of a vast tropical ocean and its shorelines &ndash; where the player having accumulated the most victory points will have their animal crowned the Dominant Species.\n\nBut somebody better become dominant quickly, because there&rsquo;s a large asteroid heading this way....\n\nGame Play\n\nThe large hexagonal tiles are used throughout the game to create an ever-expanding interpretation of the main ocean on earth as it might have appeared tens of millions of years ago. The smaller Hydrothermal Vent tiles will be placed atop some of the larger tiles throughout play, converting them into Vents in the process.\n\nThe action pawns drive the game. Each pawn allows a player to perform the various actions that can be taken&mdash;such as speciation, environmental change, migration or evolution. When placed on the action display, a pawn will immediately trigger that particular action for its owning player. Dominant Species: Marine includes new &ldquo;special&rdquo; pawns that can be acquired during the course of play. These special pawns have enhanced placement capabilities over the &ldquo;basic&rdquo; pawns that each player begins the game with.\n\nGenerally, players will be trying to enhance their own animal&rsquo;s survivability while simultaneously trying to hinder that of their opponents&rsquo;&mdash;hopefully collecting valuable victory points along the way. The various cards will aid in these efforts, giving players useful one-time abilities, ongoing benefits, or an opportunity for recurring VP gains.\n\nThroughout the game species cubes will be added to, moved about on, and removed from the tiles in play (&ldquo;earth&rdquo;). Element disks will be added to and removed from both animals and earth.\n\nWhen the game ends, players will conduct a final scoring of each tile and score their controlled special pawns&mdash;after which the player controlling the animal with the highest VP total wins the game.\n\nDominant Species Veterans\n\nFor players of the original Dominant Species, this iteration introduces several key evolutions to the system (pun definitely intended): \n\n     Actions are taken immediately whenever a pawn is placed instead of waiting to execute actions after all pawns are on the board. This gives players a bit more flexibility in their strategy, doesn&rsquo;t increase game time when more pawns are acquired by players, and lessens the brain-burn quite a bit since it alleviates the burden of having to plan out an entire turn in advance. \n     Domination is no longer on a per-tile basis, and is no longer &lsquo;competitive&rsquo; with other players. In this game you check dominance for each element type over the entire earth, and whether or not you dominate an element type is independent of whether one or more opponents also dominate it. Domination of an element is how you acquire &ndash; and try to maintain &ndash; control of the special pawns.\n     Animals no longer have default special abilities. Now, players are dealt 3 Trait cards during setup, choosing one to keep and putting the others back in the box. The chosen Trait gives their animal one of eighteen unique abilities spread amongst the Trait cards. \n     Acquiring special pawns through domination gives a player great flexibility in planning and executing a strategy. Special pawns can &lsquo;bump&rsquo; an opponent&rsquo;s basic pawn in order to take an action that would otherwise be blocked. They can be placed anywhere on the action display (where basic pawns must be placed in top-to-bottom order only). There are powerful action spaces where only a special pawn can be placed. And at the end of the game, each special pawn awards its owner VPs according to its highest achieved dominance value.\n\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UTBiMz6852dq3K_yfpgpLQ__small/img/JNsz6atITE84iWPiiq7ki1LaSGY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5998666.jpg", "complexity": 3.6908, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 4, "playing_time": 150, "categories": ["Animals", "Environmental", "Prehistoric"], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Grid Movement", "Hexagon Grid", "Map Addition", "Open Drafting", "Tile Placement", "Variable Phase Order", "Variable Player Powers", "Worker Placement"], "types": ["strategygames"], "bestwith": [4], "recommendedwith": [2, 3, 4], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 262941}, {"name": "Verdant", "yearpublished": 2022, "bayesaverage": 6.78642, "average": 7.2751, "usersrated": 6841, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/334065", "description": "Verdant is a puzzly spatial card game for 1 to 5 players.

They do this by placing a new tile, consisting of one volcano and two other types of landscape. A tile must always touch at least one other tile, when placed at sea level, or be placed on top of at least two other tiles (without any gaps under the land being created), with the volcano being placed on top of an existing volcano.\nNext, the player will place one or more wooden buildings; huts, temples or towers. Settlements must always start at the lowest level, by placing a single hut. From there on, existing settlements may expand by placing huts on all hexes of a single type of terrain around the settlement, with temples once the settlement takes up at least three hexes, or with towers, placed at level three or above.\n\nThe game ends when all tiles have been placed. At that point, the player who's placed most temples wins. Ties are broken by towers, then huts.

In every game, you select devious plots and challenge your opponents on the field of battle, through back alley intrigue, and in the political arena. Whether you play a against a single opponent, in a game known as a joust, or engage in a battle of three or more players, called a melee, winning challenges against your opponents is the way to victory.\n\nYour ultimate goal in A Game of Thrones: The Card Game is to gain influence over the greatest seat of power in Westeros: the Iron Throne! To achieve this goal, you must call upon iconic characters, such as Tywin Lannister, Robb Stark, Stannis Baratheon, Daenerys Targaryen, Euron Crow's Eye, The Red Viper, and dozens of others. You must maneuver the members of your House and your allies in a constant battle to gain power. The first player to claim fifteen power wins!\n\nIn the game, each player has two decks: a draw deck and a plot deck. Your draw deck contains the tactical elements of your struggle, including the characters, locations, attachments, and events that you call upon in your struggle to claim the Iron Throne. You can command characters from throughout A Song of Ice and Fire, and you can march forth from the icy walls of Winterfell or muster your armies around Casterly Rock. You may even equip your characters with storied weapons, such as the Valyrian steel blades Ice or Widow's Wail. The draw deck holds these powerful characters, locations, attachments, and events. This deck is randomly shuffled and players draw their hands from this deck.\n\nAt the start of each round, each player simultaneously chooses and reveals one of the plot cards from their individual seven-card plot decks. Your plot for a round determines how much gold you can spend on cards, which player starts with initiative, and how powerful your challenges are. Your plot also bears a reserve value, which determines how many cards you can keep in your hand past the end of the round. Plots may also offer powerful effects that can trigger when the plots are revealed or persist to shape the entire game round. You may scorch the earth with a deadly wildfire assault, or call upon all players to support the faith of the Seven.\n\nA Game of Thrones: The Card Game (Second Edition) differs from the first edition of the game due to elements being cut, elements being revised or updated, and elements being added. Influence was a holdover from the game's origin as a CCG and is now unnecessary, while crests offered nothing to distinguish them from traits and made the game more difficult for new players to learn. Existing keywords have been pruned, and some new keywords have been added to showcase the most interesting and essential interactions.\n\nThe timing rules &mdash; such as the details of moribund, passive effects with triggers, and save/cancel responses &mdash; will be replaced with a more straightforward timing system that takes advantage of the Interrupt, Reaction, and Forced triggers that have been successfully employed in some of FFG's newer LCGs.\n\nThe second edition also includes two new factions beyond the six Houses in the first edition. New deck-building rules empower players with more options in combining factions, alongside a means of building more focused and specialized plot decks.", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2gP4Uti9RPquZVlweeapLw__small/img/fe1ELDopk_qSeiDruI0hs8nmzSQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2783386.jpg", "complexity": 3.5294, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 4, "playing_time": 120, "categories": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Collectible Components", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Negotiation", "Novel-based", "Political"], "mechanics": ["Alliances", "Hand Management", "Open Drafting", "Race", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Take That", "Turn Order: Stat-Based", "Variable Player Powers"], "types": ["cgs"], "bestwith": [2], "recommendedwith": [2, 3, 4], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 169255}, {"name": "Arcs: The Blighted Reach Expansion", "yearpublished": 2024, "bayesaverage": 6.78211, "average": 8.86147, "usersrated": 1624, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/363757", "description": "By adding the Blighted Reach Campaign Expansion, you can also play Arcs in an innovative micro-campaign, where each game is one episode in an epic trilogy that stretches across an even larger galaxy.\n\nEveryone begins as petty regents in a dying empire, but your fates quickly diverge.

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.\n\n    \n\n\n\n Star Wars: Destiny is a collectible dice and card game of battles between iconic heroes and villains that encompasses characters, locations, and themes from the entire Star Wars saga.\n\nIn Star Wars: Destiny, two players engage in a fast-paced duel, each striving to eliminate the other's characters first. The game's innovative mechanisms combine dice-driven combat with faction-driven hand management. Straightforward rules make the game easy to learn, but also enable deep strategic thinking and clever deck-building. Players can create decks that include characters from every faction and any era, as long as heroes and villains are on opposite sides of the fight. For example, Padm&eacute; Amidala might fight alongside Rey and Finn, taking on Jabba the Hutt, Kylo Ren, and Jango Fett.\n\nEach round, you use your characters' abilities, an assortment of dice, and a carefully constructed thirty-card deck filled with events, upgrades, and supports. You and your opponent alternate actions: activating your dice, playing cards from your hand, attacking your foes, and claiming the battlefield. You need to prove your skills and defeat your opponent's characters to claim your destiny!\n\nAt launch in November 2016, Star Wars: Destiny consists of two starter sets &mdash; Rey and Kylo Ren, each with nine dice and 24 cards &mdash; and the Awakenings booster packs, each containing one die and five cards.\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wXqxBwfHnCCkPA04L6g2Og__small/img/mVp0hoQwH5l1Llw8O24DAtVQFiQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3363466.jpg", "complexity": 2.4444, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 2, "playing_time": 30, "categories": ["Card Game", "Collectible Components", "Dice", "Fighting", "Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Science Fiction"], "mechanics": ["Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Variable Player Powers"], "types": ["cgs"], "bestwith": [2], "recommendedwith": [2], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 205359}, {"name": "Blood Bowl (2016 Edition)", "yearpublished": 2016, "bayesaverage": 6.77611, "average": 7.9729, "usersrated": 2796, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/212445", "description": "Description from the publisher:\n\nBlood Bowl is a game of Fantasy Football. The basic game features a match between two teams drawn from a number of fantasy archetypes, playing a warped version of American Football.\n\nThe Blood Bowl boxed game contains two teams: Humans, an all-round team who are flexible enough to adapt to any style of play, or Orcs, who make up in brute force what they lack in finesse. The teams are represented by coloured plastic miniatures, and push-fit assembly is required before use. The game is expandable, and additional rules and teams will be made available through expansion sets and supplements.\n\nActions in the game are resolved through the use of dice. Regular six-sided dice are used to make tests in a number of cases, such as when a player attempts to pick up the ball, pass it, catch it or dodge past an enemy player. Custom dice are used when one player wishes to Block another, using graphics to represent each of the different (but all violent) potential outcomes.\n\nThe rules in this edition of Blood Bowl are almost identical to those found in the Competition Rules Pack, which was the culmination of several years of development of the Blood Bowl Living Rulebook. This has resulted in an incredibly well-honed game which sees regular competition play around the world. In fact each team takes turns moving, blocking and advancing the football down the field.

Whether or not their plan will work out, one thing is certain: Not every guest will leave this inn alive.\n\nThe Bloody Inn is a card game in which you play one member of a family of greedy, murderous innkeepers. At the start of each round, cards are placed face up to fill the inn with guests. Each card carries a cost representing how many cards a player must discard from her hand in order to take an action related to that card. Certain guests have an affinity for particular actions, so those cards return to a player's hand after being discarded. Cards also show how much money, in francs, each guest possesses. A round has two phases in which players take one action each, in turn order. Players choose one of the following actions:\n\n     bribe a guest into becoming an accomplice (take a card from the inn to their hand)\n     build an annex (move a card from their hand to their player area; it now represents a structure under which a victim may be buried)\n     kill a guest (move a card from the inn to their player area, awaiting burial)\n     bury a victim (place an unburied victim card under an annex card and take the money from the victim's pockets)\n     launder money (players may only have a certain amount of cash on hand; excess must be converted to 10F checks by the local notary)\n\n\nAt the end of the round, if any room of the inn contains one of the police, then they conduct an investigation; if a player has any unburied victims, then he must pay 10F per victim to the local gravedigger to hurredly &mdash; and quietly &mdash; bury the bodies!

When any player has six or fewer tokens in their supply, each player takes two more turns, then the game ends. At that point, if they've created a continuous path between the two cities on a ticket, then they score the points on that ticket; if not, then they lose points instead.\n\nTicket to Ride: Rails & Sails puts a few twists on the TtR formula, starting with split card decks of trains and ships (with all of the wild cards going in the train deck). Three cards of each type are revealed at the start of the game, and when you draw cards, you replace them with a card from whichever deck you like. (Shuffle the card types separately to form new decks when needed.)\n\nSimilarly, players choose their own mix of train and ship tokens at the start of the game. To claim a train route (rectangular spaces), you must play train cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with train tokens, and to claim a ship route (oval spaces), you must play ship cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with ship tokens. Ship cards depict one or two ships on them, and when you play a double-ship card, you can cover one or two ship spaces. You can take an action during play to swap train tokens for ships (or vice versa), and you lose one point for each token you swap.\n\nSome tickets show tour routes with multiple cities instead of simply two cities. If you build a network that matches the tour exactly, you score more points than if you simply include all of those cities in your network.\n\nEach player also starts the game with three harbors. If you have built a route to a port city, you can take an action during the game to place a harbor in that city (with a limit of one harbor per port). To place the harbor, you must discard two train cards and two ship cards of the same color, all of which must bear the harbor symbol (an anchor). At the end of the game, you lose four points for each harbor not placed, and you gain 10-40 points for each placed harbor depending on how many of your completed tickets show that port city.\n\nTicket to Ride: Rails & Sails includes a double-sided game board, with one side showing the world and the other side showing the Great Lakes of North America. Players start with a differing number of cards and tokens depending on which side they play, and each side has a few differences in gameplay.\n\nPart of Ticket to Ride series.", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KaTRZHY0XpW-ZSgjaRNzmg__small/img/gGMP1QhYWoI6w3Y1p3BarUNuwRg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3066862.jpg", "complexity": 2.4712, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 5, "playing_time": 120, "categories": ["Nautical", "Trains"], "mechanics": ["Connections", "Hand Management", "Network and Route Building", "Open Drafting", "Set Collection"], "types": ["familygames"], "bestwith": [4], "recommendedwith": [2, 3, 4, 5], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 202670}, {"name": "Churchill", "yearpublished": 2015, "bayesaverage": 6.76387, "average": 7.66784, "usersrated": 3382, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/132018", "description": "The players in the game take on the roles of Churchill, Roosevelt, or Stalin as they maneuver against each other over the course of 10 Conferences that determine who will lead the Allied forces, where those forces will be deployed, and how the Axis will be defeated. The player whose forces collectively have greater control over the surrendered Axis powers will win the peace and the game.\n\nChurchill is NOT a wargame, but a political conflict of cooperation and competition. While the game focuses on 10 of the historical conferences from 1943 till the end of the war these and much of this design should not be taken literally. Before and after each conference small groups of advisors and senior officials moved between the Allied capitals making the deals that drove the post war peace. Each conference sees one of a group of issues nominated for inclusion in the conference. The issues categories are: Theater leadership changes, directed offensives, production priorities, clandestine operations, political activity, and strategic warfare (A-bomb). Each of the historical conference cards independently puts some number of issues such as directed offensives or production priorities metaphorically put on the table, while the players nominate an additional 7 issues.\n\nThe game display for this is a circular conference table that the three players sit around behind their 'seat'. Each player has a staff deck of named personages, such as Secretary Stimson and Anthony Eden that are randomly drawn to make your conference hand. A pre-conference round of cards gives leverage to the winner who then moves an issue toward their side of the table equal to the value of the card played. Play then proceeds with the conference where each player in turn plays a card on one of the issues in the center of the conference table moving it the value of the card toward his side of the table. Each card is a historical personage and they often have bonuses if played on a particular category of issue. Contesting an issue has you move an issue away from an Ally toward your own. At all times each player has his Head of State card (Roosevelt, Churchill, or Stalin) that can weigh in on any issue once per conference by discarding another card. Each use of your personage has a bonus and a potential penalty. Each time Roosevelt is used he may die and be replaced by Harry Truman. Churchill can have a heart attack and miss the next conference, while Stalin's paranoia may cause a mini-purge and reduce his side's effectiveness for the remainder of the conference. The net result of the conference play is players will 'win' various issues with the player who won the most issues gaining leverage in one of the bilateral global issues (UK versus USSR global issue is Free Europe versus Spheres of Influence).\n\nThe game then moves into a post-conference phase where players implement the issues that they now control. These actions impact three basic game functions: clandestine operations, political activity, and military offensives. Clandestine operations has players try to establish political networks in conquered countries and colonies. Using a very simple mechanic of placing a network or removing an opponent's network, the historical ferment that occurred in Yugoslavia, France and across the world is simply simulated. A country or colony can only have one dominant side's network at any given time, and during political activity players can emplace friendly governments in exile that can be subsequently undermined and replaced if the supporting networks are later neutralized by one of your allies.\n\nOnce this has all been sorted out, the military portion of the game keeps the score. There is a separate display that abstractly represents the major theaters of war, Western, Eastern, Mediterranean, Arctic (Murmansk convoys and Scandinavia), CBI, SW Pacific, Central Pacific, and Far East. Each of these tracks has a Allied front for which I am looking for some kind of 3D tank piece that advances toward Germany, Italy, and Japan. Using a very simple combat mechanic, each front tries to advance with Axis reserves deploying to oppose the various fronts. A successful offensive advances the front one space, although with overwhelming superiority a two-space breakthrough is possible. Naval operations are simply handled by requiring a defined level of support to advance into an amphibious entry space such as France (D-Day). When a front enters Germany, Italy or Japan they surrender, shutting down military operations, although clandestine and political activity continues until the end of the game. In the background is the development of the A-bomb and Soviet efforts to steal its secrets. If the A-bomb is available Japan can be forced to surrender sans a direct invasion.\n\nAs I stated this is not a wargame, but a three-player excursion into power politics. The game takes around 3 hours to finish, but I will be including a short and medium scenario. All scenarios end with Potsdam, but you will be able to start later in the war if you only have 1 or 2 hours to play. In addition the game can be played with 3 or 2 players plus solitaire. I am very excited about the new Churchill and large scale playtesting will commence by the end of the month.

Twelve legendary tasks are imposed upon the fearless participants: to erect graceful statues, to raise awe-inspiring sanctuaries, to offer capacious offerings, and to slay the most fearsome monsters.

Rolling the dice (at the start of the turn) is equivalent to consulting the oracle, whereas the results represent her answers. The answers determine which actions you will be able to take, but you will always have three actions per turn. However, a slight divergence from your fate is often possible.\n\nIn addition to the oracle, you can request support from the gods and you can acquire favor tokens, companions, and other special abilities that will help you win the race against other competitors.\n\nDifferently equipped ships and the variable set-up of the game board will offer new challenging and interesting strategic and tactical decisions with every new game of The Oracle of Delphi that you play.", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tZFlvhcA97SjyNGurpU6Ag__small/img/fMd29Q6_L8VxO4tLCJROZT7p4is=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3574541.jpg", "complexity": 3.0338, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 4, "playing_time": 100, "categories": ["Ancient", "Mythology", "Nautical"], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Modular Board", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Push Your Luck", "Race", "Variable Player Powers"], "types": ["strategygames"], "bestwith": [3, 4], "recommendedwith": [2, 3, 4], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 193558}, {"name": "Treasure Island", "yearpublished": 2018, "bayesaverage": 6.75639, "average": 7.20707, "usersrated": 6943, "link": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/242639", "description": "Long John Silver's crew has committed mutiny and has him cornered and tied up!

In the end, the most prominent citizen in Carson City &mdash; as measured by victory points that can be won both during and after the game &mdash; wins.\n\nCarson City: Gold & Guns, the first expansion, contains updated buildings and houses, new buildings, new double-sided characters, the \"Indian\" character (previously a promotional item at Spiel 2010), and a separate expansion called \"The Outlaws\".\n\nCarson City: Horses & Heroes, the second expansion, lets players visit the rodeo to claim additional victory points and use horses to unlock special actions. Three new characters are also added to the game.", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/haPZu-OX6HcWBa-aeMSuYA__small/img/-24eW1P5FdXtfsEgKbU6W503YPs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4023278.jpg", "complexity": 3.2, "min_players": 2, "max_players": 6, "playing_time": 180, "categories": ["American West", "City Building", "Economic"], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Dice Rolling", "Tile Placement", "Variable Player Powers", "Worker Placement"], "types": ["strategygames"], "bestwith": [4], "recommendedwith": [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], "pareto_rank": 8, "id": 177352}]
